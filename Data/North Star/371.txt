 l)sa* I'ricsd Doiroutss -—f take advan
 uge of the bailing of Her Urtianiur Majes
 ty s Steamer Plumper for Jamaica, to give
 vou tb® history of this day, which will in all j
 probability, be regarded hereafter one of;
 iha most eventful that have evot dawned
 upon Haiti. Uoubiksn, the new* that 1 am
 about to communicate will appear incredible
 and 1 must confess, tb it matters wear almost
 a dreamlike aspect to myself, who base been
 a spectator of the various scenes that have
 transpired wuhin the last twelve hours. But,
 to be brief, as mv tunc is limited. I
 This morning, about ten o’clock, palms ot
 triumph were to he seen waving before all
 the doors, and suspended to all the galleries
 of this goodly city of Port-au-Prince. The
 drums beat, rhe trumpets sounded, the can
 nons roared, the people shouted—and Haiti
 became an Empire Yes, a veritable empire,
 with its tmpeiia! family in esse, audits dukes,
 counts, marshals and other titled dignitaries'
 »n futuro. The change, certainly, is a Bud
 dsn ono; and wc who, upon rising this mor-,
 rung, snuffed the airs ot a republic, and now 1
 inhale the atmosphere of a monarchy, might
 well regard it as nothing but a fantastic vis
 ion, were it not for the vast amount of ocular
 and auricular demonstration to the contrary.;
 And ycl, no violent outburst, no effusion
 of blood, marked this transition from one
 form of poliyical existence to another. l&gt;u-1
 ally, when a people, grown tired of the
 governmental fabric which hitherto has shel-
 tered them, resolve to tear it down and con
 struct another, it chances that some tenacious
 lover of the time-honored edifice, or some ar-
 dent laborer in the work of demolition, finds,
 a willing or unwilling grave beneath the fall-
 mg stones and flying rafters. But no such
 event has taken place here. Ihe republican
 scaffolding which, for forty-six years, fits
 served its purpose but indifferently well, and
 which many persons’regarded as a permanency,
 has been quietly taken down and he, who,
 yesterday, was the President Soulouque, is
 now, by the grace of God and “the Sover
 eignty of the People,’ Faustin the lirst,
 Emperor of Haiti. With regard to the new
 structure, it remains for the future to judge
 of the correctness and purity of its style, the
 justness of its proportions, and the strength
 of its columns.
 This change, also, has been almost as un
 expected as it wassudden. I rue, any obser
 ver of events might have foreseen it for some
 tine back but even then, only as a contin
 gency which might take place in the course of
 years. However, the first intimation that the
 period was at hand, was the appearance of a
 Circular on Thursday ia9t, to the effect that,
 in consideration of the eminent services ren-l
 dered to the country by His Excellency, the.
 President, he sheuld he named Emperor.
 This document was signed by a large number'
 of persons; action was taken upon it last,
 evening, in the Senate and Chamber of Hep- j
 resentatives; and, in accordance with this
 action, Haiti ceased, this morning, to be a
 republic. A very quiet and respectable Revo
 lution, certainly and in all respects, totally j
 different from those of which Europe recently 1
 has boen, and still is the theatre. But, to re-1
 turn to the affairs of the day.
 Hearing the repeated discharges of artille
 ry, this morning, I hastened out into the
 streets, and learned that the Senate had just
 made proclamation of the establishment of the
 Empire; and that body, accompanied by
 life Representatives, had already proceeded to
 the Palace to offer the imperial diadem to
 his newly created Majesty. On my may, I
 encountered the troops, crowned with gar
 lands, onjtheir march lo the Church, with
 beating drums and flying colors. Shortly af
 terwards, the Imperial cortege came into
 view. It consisted of the Emperor, the Em
 press and two of their nieces, on foot and at
 tended by the General Officers of the Army,
 and various other military ami high civil au
 thorities of the Government. His Majesty
 was attired in the most simple uniform and,
 indeed, a bearing in all respects, the most be
 coming, marked the first appearance of the
 new dynasty in public. Arrived at the C hurcb,
 a solemn 'le Deum was chanted—wild bursts
 of martial music, ever and anon, mingling
 with the deeptoned harmony of the choir. At
 the close of this service, the bells pealed,
 the cannons again fired repeated salutes: and,
 amidst liudand reiterated cries of ive VEm
 pereur, the most important ceremonies of the
 day were terminated. The Empress and her
 niece# returned, in a carriage, to the Palace
 while the Emperor, mounting his horse, pro
 ceeded, with ins usual attendance, to make a
 turn through the city.
 Manv true friends of Haiti will, perhaps,
 see in this revolution, much cause of regret;
 and it certainly is asa l thing to see a re
 public sink into an empire. But, although
 an ardent admirer of the political institutions
 of my native land, and a iirui believer m hei
 political creed, still 1 cannot but tliiuk thai
 there are many persons, outside of the wall*
 of lunatic asylums, and yet within the pre
 cincts of civilisation, who are utterly unfit for
 self-government. And perhaps, (a* with the
 ■tifl-necked Israelites, who demanded
 king,) it may be necessary for the eventual
 well-being of this country, that she be ruled
 with a strong hand and a rod of iron. Possi
 bly, the-‘imperial authority may present a
 front sufficiently imposing to keep in checl
 the fierce oulbreakings, which hav# lor si
 long a period, saddened her history.

 Kkolako. The Pham Congress in Pans
 supplies the English pa pen with a topic. The
 Koneonforauat has aa article on the subject,
 written with the usual ability of that paper.
 The doodutton of that article is aa follows:
 We believe io Christianity, and Christiani
 ty breathes snd inculcates a spirit of peace.
 The question is, whether ihe gospel proposes
 anything as sn object of human pursuit which
 is in itself of no moment, or, however impor
 tant, unattainable. To this question our ret
 aou and our faith directly answer, “No!” If,
 then, the thing cen be dune, if it ought to be
 done, if there is a oeede-be for doing it, why
 not do it now 1 Public opinion, human pen
 sions, dynastic habits, national aspirations, we
 are told, are against it. Be it so—but will
 they ever become changed without effort, and
 must not all effort have a commencement
 Earnest working can change the dreams ol
 one age into the realities of the next. “Faith”
 of the right sort “can remove mountain*.”
 Meanwhile, Providence plainly co-operate*
 with the peace- maker*. Dynasties and gov
 ernments have nearly come to the bottom of
 their military resource** The sword will be
 no sooner sheathed again in Europe, tfian the
 penalties of haring drawn it will begin to be
 exacted. Ruinous taxation, or a general dis
 armament, will become the altei native of all
 European states. The system has reached
 its zenith. It cannot be pushed farther.
 It cannot remain as it is. ljet it once begin
 its decline, and it* descent will be more rapid
 than its rise

 Never to riee again.”
 The Cholera is on the increase in London.
 The deaths for the week ending Bth inat.,
 were 2796, of which 1,603 were of cholera.
 It was also spreading rapidly in different parta
 of England. A proposal is afloat to obtain a
 royal proclamation appointing a day of na
 tional humiliation, fasting, and prayer, on ac
 count of the disease now so fearfully preva
 lent. Probably, as was the case here, those
 who talk moat about fasting for sin, are the
 farthest from repentance. The continued
 fatality of the cholera in the metropolis has
 drawn attention once more to the subject of
 sanitary precaution*. Intermural burial is
 the chief object of attack. Burial yard* in
 great cities are denounced as a disgrace to
 the age. And so they are. The Times,
 true to its usual instincts of aiding with the
 strnng, pounces fuiiousl y upon some of th
 small private nuisances in that way but
 passes by the burial-grounds connected-with
 the numerous churches throughout the city.
 The Bishop of London and the clergy must
 have their fees out of the burials —no matter
 although the public arc poisoned by the im
 pure atmosphere. They have power, and
 wealth, and influence on their side there
 fore the Times is silent, or at the best only
 veiy gently hints at the existence of the Es
 tablished Church share of the nuisance,
 which is by far the largest and most offen
 sive.
 The recent brutal murder in Bermondsey
 by the woman Manning and her husband, is
 exciting much interest. Jhe coroner s Jury
 have biought in a verdict against them. Man
 ning is said to be delighted with the notice
 taken of him. In his examination he denied
 having any share in the murder.
 An influential Committee lias been organ
 ised in London, for the purpose of collecting
 a fund for the relief, of the Italian patriots now
 in London. Among the members of that
 Committee, we see the names of Lord Dudley
 Stewart, M. P., Richard Cobden, M. P.,
 Joseph Hume, M. P., Chas. Dickens, Esq.,
 Walter Savage Landor, Esq. The Com
 mittee has issued an address, Irom the pen of
 Charles Dickens, which says, “The funds
 raised are proposed to be applid to the relief
 of the more immediate and urgent wants of
 the exiles, to the provision of the means of
 enabling them to reach other countries as they
 may desire, and generally to their assistance
 and protection.”
 The Anti-State Church cause seems to be
 1 progressing in England, t tne evidence of
 this been recently given at Leicester. This
 important borough has entirely emancipated
 itself from the obnoxious church-rate, li
 seems that for years past, in one of the par.
 ishes of Ijeicester, the goods of Dissenters
 have been annually sold to pay for the religion
 of their Episcopalian neighbors. This year,
 for the first time, the Dissenters have suc
 ceeded in obtaining a majority againat the

 On the 21st ult. Gen. Ondioot officially
 announced his departure from Rome. The

 institution of a Commiasioa for tbs purpose of
 prosecuting the authors and accomplices of
 the outrages committed doting the Revolu
 tionary period against “religion, its ministers,
 the majesty of the sovereign, sod public se
 curity.” The Pope has divulged his plan ol
 government. His Holiness concedes to his
 subjects extensive municipal franchises. In
 each district there is to be a municipality, tb
 members of which are to be elected by tbe
 inhabitants, tbe electoral right being granted
 to almost every male individual in tbe district.
 The Pope reserves to himself tbe choice of
 mayors and deputy mayors, who are to be
 selected from among the members of the mu
 nicipal bodies. His Holiness also proposes
 the establishment in each province of a pro
 vincial council whose powers will be vwy
 similar to those of grand juries in England. In
 addition to these, a State Consult a" com
 posed of one delegate from each province,
 and as many members as the Pope may pleass
 to appoint, is to meet at Rome. This with
 the Council of State, will constitute the po

 Austria and Hungary. Comorn and

 result of which was that a Hungarian Major
 was senuto Gen. Haynau to arrange terms

 Collins Center, 9mo. 10, 1849. j
 Dear Friend, —Since my late letter to
 thee, an indignation meeting has been held at
 this place. As 1 have thought a statement of
 ts doings would b 8 interesting to fliee, I have
 concluded to give thee a copy of its proceed
 ings. They are as follow
 At a meeting of the friends of the Slave
 without regard to party or name, held at Col
 lins, Center the 28th of Bth ino. 1849,
 Win. Henry was chosen Chaitman and
 Andrew Varney Secretary.
 Resolved, That a committee of three be
 appointed to report business for the considera
 tion of this meeting.
 Resolved, That Cornelius Smith, Lorenzo
 Mabbett and Elisha W. Henry be said Com
 mittee.
 The following Resolutions were according
 ly reported to the meeting and being separately
 considered, were unanimously adopted, save
 only one dissenting voice on one resolution.
 Whereas it having come to out knowledge
 that considerable search has recently been
 made on or about the Indianßeservation in this
 vicinity, for a slave* said to have bean a few
 months since the house servant of a distin
 guished individual at the South, and whereas
 there are reasons to believe that some persons
 have been employed, and others quite likaly
 to be, who are entirely reckless of the great
 and fundamental doctrine of this nation's Lib
 erty and Independence, viz. that all men are
 endowed by their Creator with certain inalien
 able rights, among which are Lite, Liberty
 and the pursuit of happiness, it ia therefore
 hereby
 1. Resolved, That any person who will
 suffer himself to be hired or m any other way
 influenced to seek and return the poor panting
 fugitive, ia not only unworthy the name of an
 American Citizen, but should he regarded as a
 base minion and willing instrument of tha
 slave power.
 2. Resolved, That if any of our fellow citi
 -1 tens of this town or ‘vicinity should be demo
 ted m aiding or giving countenance to the
 kidnapper and slavocatcher, such persona
 shall receive such a stigma as nothing but
 repentance and amendment of life can remove.
 3. Resolvedt Thai we repudiate the idea
 that it ia necessary for the Slave to go to
 Canada in order to secure his Freedom, but
 that every human being whether from the
 north, from tbe aouth, from the east or from
 the west, may and must be entitled alike with
 our own citizens to all the immunities, guaran
 tied to all who compose the population of our
 noble State.
 4. Resolved, That the jaws and paws of
 the British Luio are not necessarily any mao
 effectual in the protection of the weak aor
 defenceless, &lt;han the beak aud claws of th
 American Eagle.
 5. Resolved, That we are in favor of all
 honorable moans for the promotion of freedom
 and the suppression and destruction of slave
 ry, and that wa recognize and daily appreciate
 the efforts of tbe Free Labor Association ot
 this town and vicinity, and bid them Godspeed
 ,n their enterprise.
 6. Resolved, That wa will use all efforts
 in oar power to make oar town as wall known
 as tha Home of Freedom and the retreat at
 the oppressed aa it is now distinguished for
 its Better sad Cheese in short may it aver
 be in a proper aeaae the empire town of the
 Empire State.
 7. Resolved,That tbe House resolve itself in
 to e vigilant Committee for the purpose of ettry
 ing out the spirit of tha abovt Resolutions.
 8. Moved sad seconded that a copy of these

 Dui Friend —There having been coo
 adorable inquiry ia this vicinity for a fugitive
 Slave, a few moothe since the body servant o
 a distinguish*! ia#ividual ta the southern
 states, and it being conjectured, too, that tbete
 would be an application to oar Governor for a
 requisition to take aaid slave, on tbc plea that
 be waa guilty of room crime, it seemed dea*
 rable by the fnends of freedom and the Slave
 in this locality to be apprised of the facts in
 the case. In their behalf, then, I would ask
 whether thou hast received any applications
 for a requisition to take a slave or pietended
 eiiminal, within the last thtee or six mouths,
 ahd if so, whether such applications have been
 complied with, and in what instances? If
 no request has yet been made for the requisite
 authority in anv such case, it may be proper
 for me to say tnat the people in this District
 and region of country are desirous that thou
 should be duly apprised that men who are so
 reckless of the principles of Freedom as to
 hold ss property not only their fellow beings,
 but in many instances, their own flesh and
 blood, are dot very likely to have conscienti
 ous scruples in making false oaths that tbeir
 fugitive Slaves have been guilty of theft.
 Please do the friends of the slave the
 favor to reply to this brief communication at
 thy earliest convenience.
 We wish to know whether the state of
 New York is a safe leireat for the poor toil
 worn Slave; or whether he must contrive
 to go on to Canada. Be assured that the
 sons of oppression may be safe in this region
 of Western New York, unless Gvo. Fish lends
 his name and influence to the oppreasor for
 their recapture.
 For the redemption of our noble state from
 the service of the Southern Autocrat, the
 Tyrant and oppressor thy Friend,
 LORENZO MABBETT.
 REPLY.

 Albany Aug. 23,1849. J
 Sir :—Your favor of 21st inst. is this day
 received. You ask whether I have received
 within three or six months any requisition for
 a Slave, a pretended criminal.
 I have during that period received several
 requisitions for alleged criminals or fugitives
 from Justice—hut none where 1 had any rea
 son to suppose the alleged fugitive had ever
 been claimed as a Slave and as such helJ in
 involuntary Servitude.
 As you do not mention any name I cannot
 say positively whether any application has
 been made for the individual to whom you re
 fer. But I have no recollection of any appli
 cation which could have referred to such a
 person as your letter alludes to.
 With great respect, your obedient servant.

 CoasCMfTlOB. There is perhaps no disease
 with which our country is aff-oted, which sweet*
 iff so many victims, as that fell destroyer of the
 human race Consumption. Day after day, tear
 after year, that insatiate monster hurries to the por
 tals of tlie cold and silent tomb fresh added victims
 to it* conquest. No walk of life is sacred from its
 blighting influence. No age is exempt from its
 death-dealing shafts. The old, the middle-aged ami
 the young, all alike, are food for this common enemy
 if mankind. 'The white-haired patriarch, whose
 life of temperance lias rendered his system impervi
 &gt;us to the attacks of oilier ills, and whose good 1
 deeds prepared him for the enjoyment of life’s calm
 evening, finds Consumption fastening it- fangs upon
 tia vitals,and tearing him from a world ever bright
 to minds which look complacently on days well
 (pent.
 Is there no help for tlie afflicted T—no preventive
 &gt;f the dangers which beset us in our changeable anti
 ickle chine? We think there is. And if the alle
 gations of those who are at least entitled to veracity
 —y be believed, there is a preventive and a remedy.

 DIED i
 At Battle Creek, Mich., Amt Mott, late of the
 ;ity of Albany, N. Y., passed away on the 11th j
 nst., in tlie full rigor of her intellect. As a rose
 ■astetli off its outer leaf, slie cast off her mortal in- j
 lumbrancc, and passed into the spirit world, in the
 find year of her age. Having lived a life of use
 iilnes?, she anticipated the opening of tlie future
 vith a serenity of mind which accompanies only
 he faithful. From her early life, she was an un-
 iring advocate for the rights of tlie oppressed. She
 •ver bore a faithful testimony in tlie Society of I
 Prieads, of which slie was a membei, against their
 ipotliy in tlie various reforms of the day.

ATHOL WATER CURE.
 THE Subscriber beg* leave to call tie attention
 of Invalids, esjrecially Uio-«e suffering from
 chronic disease, to tns hydropathic establishment in
 Athol, Mas*.
 liis house was opened for tlie reception of patients
 last season, and it is believed offers excellent facili
 ties for a philosophic and tliorough course in hydro
 pathy. The supply of water is abundant, and in
 poritv has been pronounced equal to water on
 distilled.” The loeation is quite eligible, being bui
 a short distance from the V. It M. railroad. The
 vicinity abounds in a variety of scenery, and has
 charming grounds for walks and rambles. So that
 with die water, suitable regimen, mountain air, and
 exercise, patients can scarcely fail to obtain the
 healthful results for which they labor.
 The following care illustrates this remark. Mrs.
 8., wife of Item, li., of Warwick, Mass., aged
 aljoul thirty-five years, was brought to me last
 August. Her case presented die following phrim
 incoa. If placed in an erect position, ami left un
 supported, she forth witn fell backward to ihe
 ground. If being well supjiortcd, .tie made an
 rffi/rt to walk, either inn t, when carried forward,
 despite her effect* to dw* «m»rary, would cross ihe
 uthr r. She had been in ibis condition marly a
 tear. Her treatment Commenced die Ibtb ol feept.,
 and was continued to the 25th Oct. only, when site
 left, so far recovered as to be able Or walk half a
 mile with ease. Since her return to her family, *be
 has continued her bad.-, with (iwrespomiiag im
 provement to her health. She now attends to her
 domestic duties, and with the *oi,taucr of a .mall
 girl, dues the work of her firmily.
 Patients are desired to faring three comfortables,
 one pair of woollen blankets, one |&gt;air of sheets,
 half a dosen towels markeu, with old lines lor
 bandages.
 Terms, from five Ur tea dollars per week, accord
 ing to the necessities or efioire of the patients.
 Those who are less particular in the selection of
 rooms, or are w dlu.r to occupy idem in common
 with others, will he charged less.
