"nn ot be secured and perpetuated upon any
 other b*M*. Strange idea to associate with
 Republicanism!
 There w none among the free States more
 imbued with this intense selfishness than Ohio.
 The laws that have been in fores ever since
 the vear* I*o4 and I*o7, unjustly oppress her
 eolored population almost beyond the point of
 endurance. In every way they stand a*
 checks to prevent them from doing anything
 for their own improvement, to discourage any
 attempts they may make to elevate themselves,
 to degrade them in every sense of the word.
 They are evidences of the presence of those
 cherished principles no peculiarly American in
 our systems of law— class favoritism. This
 was the aim in view when the famous lllaek
 liSws were established.
 A slight notice of their hearing, may give
 the reader an idea of justice in Ohio. In the
 first place, persons of color coming into the
 State with the intention of settling, are re
 quired to produce certificates of freedom, and
 have them recorded in the office of the clerk,
 of the county in which they may settle. 'I o
 give the colored man employment just neces
 sary to aupplv the common want* of life, the
 employer, in so doing, is liable to a fine of*
 $5O, unless,” says the law, snrli black
 or mulatto person shall have one of the ccrti-;
 firates as aforesaid.” Employment is also
 forbidden them, except they shall, within j
 twenty days, (after corning into the Slate,) i
 ester into bonds with two or more freehold so-
 cun tics in the penal sum of five hundred dol- 1
 lars that they may not become a township)
 charge, and that tlioy will always behave
 themselves. Is a new balance required to j
 m°te out justice to the color.*d man? If not,
 why such a law Do they secure any par- 1
 t.rular advantages to the white citizen? Yes,
 savs one, if these parts of the Hlack Laws
 were repealed, the door would he immediately
 opened so as to permit an influx of Macks,
 driven by oppression from other States, and
 minumitted slaves, worn out in the service of
 their masters, would he sent here to be do
 jMMidcnts upon our public charitable institu-!
 tions. (iod help thorn, 1 .-av. The labor of*
 the black man, says another, would conflict
 with the interests of the white laboring 1
 classes. lie is lazy, and went work at all,
 chim'-s in a third, and so on until a hundred
 just such frivolous objections arc raised every
 time the question of roi&gt;eal is agitated.
 This kind of reasoning, however, docs not
 harmonize with tin? facts in the case. As a
 general tiling, the emigration of colored per j
 sons is not alTectcd either wav by Ihe exist
 ence of those laws. Certificates of freedom
 are not often demanded before they are al
 lowed to settle. The question is seldom
 asked as to their being, or ever having been,
 a slave. ("olorrd persons may be employed
 without the employer running much risk of
 having to pay heavy fires for so doing. The
 bonds and other requirements mentioned in the
 statutes, are not complied with one time in a
 hundred. The w hole matter stands almost a
 dead letter, so fur as the precautionary fea-
 lures of it are concerned. Then where stands
 the objection as to the importance of their be
 ing continued in iorce Does justice require
 it 1 Ou the other hand, th?v are ojiea to
 abuse?, without tending to any good results
 whatever.
 Now, there arc not more than five hundred
 in a population of twenty thousand colored
 persons in Ohio, without reference to rc-spect-
 abilty or condition, who? settlement can be
 looked upon as being legal. The remainder
 not haring complied with the law in reference
 to certificate* and bonds, what is the disad
 vantage to which they are exposed Why, I.
 this: any white person filing a complaint, the
 law say*, It shall be the duty of the over
 seers-of the poor of township w here such ne
 gro or mulatto person maybe found, to remove
 immediately such black or mulatto person in
 the same manner as is required of paupers; j
 that is, upon the complaint of the lowest
 white vagabond in the coinninuitv, against
 any of the most respectable colored citizens, i
 no matter Imw degraded the inform .'.r, or how
 w ealthy arid much thought of the latter—they
 must forthwith be expelled the Stale. No
 time is given for the adjustment of business
 private affairs must be loft unsettled. “Im-
 mediately,” is the inexorable sentence of the
 law. These arc but part of the many griev
 ances we complain of. We have asked our
 legislature to release us from the dangers of
 such euactmcnts, and grant us redress in their
 repeal.

 You have heard of the w icked uncle who

 Ltule children, you know, can’t do much
 they only cried, and cried, and cried.” “Did
 anybody hear them?” No, nobody or if
 they heard, they did not take any notice of
 them.” Were the little children all alone
 in the dark wood, among the trees, and the
 wild beasts, and the birds?” Yes, all
 alone.’ “V\ hat did they say, in the dark
 wood, among the trees, and the wild beasts, i
 and the birds' They put their little arms
 round each other’s necks, and cried to their'
 mam*- Shall I tell you what they said to

 who their mama was. She w-as a great
 lady, and lived at Washington. I will show

 aS|.&gt; u&gt; speak of the complexion of the allair,

 complaint, as set forth in the communication
 inserted below. We fro for a united hurrah

 but we cannot be instrumental in giving any
 color to the pure elements of sympathy, that
 heaves the siph and draw** the tear for the

 Now, wasn't this quite a pretty little
 speech for a little child to make Oh, the
 sly little rogue! If the alma mater of «h*»T
 little political babes at Washington, had but
 heard how well this juvenile talked about the
 compU non of the affair,’—-• a united hurrah
 for republicanism,’—* giving a refer,* Ac.;
 and how prettily he could foil about the pure

 the woods, and brought nearer home—per

 Hear it, yc heartless Abolitionists, who
 waste your sympathies on the worthless three
 millions of “niggers” at home! Keep
 your tears for foreign lands! There is no
 use for tears of sympathy iri this glorious
 republic Our three millions of slaves are
 all happy and contented. They are never
 tacked, nor chained, nor branded; they
 never think of running away from the kind,
 merciful, and generous, and chivalrous masters
 who only occasionally flog them to death
 how could they harbor the ungrateful thought!
 Iliey have it, on the high authority of Mr.
 Haskell of Tennessee, that the black man
 was made for the benefit of the white man.**
 Who can doubt that he speaks the words of
 Heaven-inspired wisdom! Why, then, waste
 your tears upon these slaves. In this glorious
 republic there are no women overworked and
 &gt;roken-hcarted, making shirts at four cents
 i-piece! There is no underpaid labor—no
 overpaid rascality There are no cunning,
 place-seeking politicians, who throw dust in
 [srople's eyes, nor any deluded voters, on
 whose shoulders they can foist themselves
 into power. Bottle up your tears for exporta
 tion, for the white slaves of foreign lands!
 Everything in its place.”
 Now, my dear child, you are getting
 sleepy.” No, mi’; but that was such a
 long speech—l didn’t understand it at all.
 W hat is that color that the little babe in the
 woods was so terribly afraid of!” Color
 is a very fearful thing—it means black there
 is no color but black.” Oh, yes, there's
 red, and blue, and white, and, oh, ever so
 many more.’’ “3mne Abolitionist must
 have told you that; but you know they be
 lieve in the good old-fashioned doctrine of the
 Constitution, that All men are born equal,
 md have certain inalienable rights;’ but a
 rre.it many who imagine themselves repub

 ivho have black faces have no rights.”
 Couldn't black men paint their faces w liite,
 tnd then they would not he made slaves any
 norc “Perhaps they would: it is not
 or their color only that the black men arc
 nade slaves. The spirit of slave-making is
 .a those who hold slaves. Brave, generous,
 noble-minded men never oppress the weak
 md defenceless; while the mean and cow
 ardly are always tyrants. Black men and
 women are mostly ignorant, and therefore
 weak and as those men who pretend to be
 so afraid of what they call color, are not
 iioble, and brave, and generous, it is quite
 natural for them to oppress those who
 launot defend themselves.” “Is it not very
 wrong to make slaves of black men You
 must not talk so, child if John C. Calhoun
 heard you, he would ‘take high and exalted
 ground,’ and call you a maniac from bedlam
 and Mr. Foote, of Mississippi, would put a
 rope round your nock, and hang you up on a
 high tree.” “Who is Mr. Foote—did I

 •OTKKSMKVT OPPOSITION.
 The government took alarm at these more
 men t?, and raked up an old act of the reign
 of Chaika 11., which prohibit* more than ten
 persona to go to the House of Commons with
 a petition, or mom than twenty to sign one.—
 Oa the strength of this act, they issued nr
 ticca forbidding the meeting. The nonunion
 declared that they would bold it nevertheless,
 but at the same time issued a proclamation as
 suring the inhabitants that they would be
 peaceable. The gorernment persisted in
 saying that they would prerent aay attempt
 like that, which conM hare no other end hot
 to intimidate the House of Commons. Here
 there was war declared on both sides. The
 police offices, on Friday and Saturday, were
 crowded with people, swearing in as special
 constables. About 200,000 were sworn in.
 The Queen went off to the Isle of Wight.
 preparations for defence.
 On Sunday, barricades of wood and bags
 of sand, with loop-hole* for guns to fire
 through, were built on the top of the bank and
 Tower cannons were placed in the post of
 fice, and a revolving battery erected in Soni
 t erect house. Fire-arms had been sent to
 i all the public offices, the Bank and the private
 Banking Houses, all the clerks being sworn
 'in as special constables, and informed that
 1 they would have to remain to defend the
 premises all Monday night. After such ex
 traordinary preparations and the bringing up
 of C or 8,000 military to London, for all the
 i available troops were brought up, even
 i Windsor Castle was deprived of its usual
 1 guard, and plaeed undei the protection of the
 1 Buckinghamshire yeomanry, people began
 oven to talk of a revolution here.
 -THE DAY APPOINTED.
 j On Monday morning the shops on the prin
 cipal roads into the city were all closed.—
 i Small bodies of special constables were to be
 seen walking about in all directions. The
 gates of the Bank w*rc guard-id by soldiers
 j with fixed bayonets. The Exchange was
 closed all day; a fqw hundreds of special con
 stables and policemen being shut np inside, to
 j l»e called out if needed. AH the bridges were
 guarded by strong bodies of police and spe
 cials, who, however, did not object to the
 people going over to the South side of the
 j river. Placards were posted about, forbidding
 carriages to stop in the streets, ancf some
 streets they were altogether prohibited from
 entering. All the Park gates were closed.—
 Hardly any business was done. Almost all
 the shops were kept closed all day. At about
 two o’clock, I went to the Stock Exchange—
 (the members were singing God save the
 Queen” all business being suspended, bv
 consent, until next day.
 THE CHARTIST MEETING.
 About 3 o'clock, a second edition of the
 Times" came out, announcing that the
 meeting had been held, and had dispersed qui
 -1 etly, and that Feargus O'Connor had taken
 the putitiou to the House of Commons with
 out his army, which he ordered to disband.—
 j Went up to the House of Commons alxmt 0
 o'clock, and found all London perfectly quiet.
 Thus ended the most extraordinary day I have
 ever seen a day in which people had appa
 rcntly conspired to make fools of each other.
 The people in Paris fully expected a revolu
 tion here, and it is evident from tho newspa
 pers that they are quite taken aback to find the
 whole pass off without a drop of blood being
 shed. The only place where anything like a
 riot occurred, was Blackfriars Br dge, which
 our sapient authorities cleared at 1 o’clock,
 and kept guarded by an immense number of
 1 police and special constables. They formed
 i a compact mass of six deep right across both
 ends of the bridge, and so when the people
 came straggling hack from Keuiiingtou Com
 mon, they were stopped, and those in front
 could not return in consequence of the great
 numbers behind. At last, when they had ac
 cumulated sufficiently, they earned specials
 and all together Ik*fare them, but not without
 a few hard blows of the batons.
 PRESENTATION OF THE PETITION.
 Feargus O'Connor presented the petition in
 the evening, and said that it bad 5,700,000
 signatures. It was to have been taken
 into consideration to-night, but last night the
 Petition Committee reported that it bad only
 1,tW0,000 signatures, and that many of these
 were forgeries. The Queen and Sir Robert
 Peel, and many other great men are made to
 sign it, and the Duke of Wellington figures
 on it seventeen times; besides, there are all
 kinds of nicknames, pug-nose, kmg-none, Ac.,
 passing for signatures. This disgraceful
 business naturally called forth strong lan
 guage. One of the member* of the Hooae
 said he weald never believe O'Connor again
 is his life. Hereupon a scene got up, and
 Mr. O'Connor said that that expression must
 be explained elsewhere, sod left the House.

 Wdk particular refmnct to'tit A frican ract,
 I Host rate! bv numerous autlientic forts, Biogi xphica
 Sketches, Testimonies of Travellers, &amp;c.
 The motives which havr actuated the author it
 preparing the aljuvc-meutioeeil work, are solely i
 desire to iutrrcst and enlighten the public uiind, ot
 a subject intimately connected with the happiness m
 mwrnr of a lanrc portion of the human family; am
 liy a relation of forts and testimonies, which v&lt;
 assertions can annul, to retnovc a deeply-rooted pre
 jodicc. existing in the minds of many, respecting thi
 African race.
 It is an iin|wrtant question whether the Negro
 i constitutionally, and tiiciTfure irremediably infeiiu
 ito tire white non, in the powers of the mind. Mud
 i of tlie future welfare of the hitman rare depends oi
 die answer which experience ami forts will funiisi
 to this question; for it ronrrms not only the vas
 population of Afrim. Imt many millions of the Ncgr
 rare, who are located elsewhere, and die whites win
 are becoming mixed w ith the black race, in ciuutrie
 where Sfovety exists, or where it lias existed til
 within a recent period. Many persons have vcntiir
 e l npon peremptory decisions on Imth shies of th
 1 question; Uit the majority ap|icar to ke still unsa tin
 fied as to the real ra|Kil&gt;ilitirs of the Negro nice.
 Ttieir present actual inferiority in many respects
 comparing thorn as a whole with the lighter colon
 ed portion of mankind, is too evident to lie disputed
 but it must la- borne In mind that tllcy are uot in t
 fit condition for a fair comparison to lie draw n be
 tween the two. Their present degraded state nrn
 lie .easily- accounted for bv tlx* circumstances amiiis
 wdii-h Negroes liave lived, fajth hi their own countn
 and abroad. Ifa single instance can la? adduced u
 1 an individual oft lie African race exhibiting a genim
 whicb would I* considered eminent in civilized Eitro
 j peart society, we liave a proof that tliere is no incom
 patibility between Negro organization and high in
 tellectual power. Rut it is not one alone, hot many
 remarkable rases of this description that are brought
 I forward in tlie present volume, w lam.li inrlwht up
 ward* of 150 Biojrrrphical tktUhcs of Africana or thru
 drocendant*. beside* Facts and Anecdotes, Tesliino

 fortunate race of Africa, proving tliem to lie eudowei
 with every characteristic constituting tlieir identity
 w ith the great fauiil of Man, and conocrjrs ntlv. en*
