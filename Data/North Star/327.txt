 Sorry arc »e that doty enjoin* end justice
 compel* u* to iccord the faet, however much
 we m*y regiet the necessity of *o doing,
 that the more aspect of oociety among our
 people is at a very low estimate at preeent
 m the city of Pittsburg and vicinity—indeed,
 the place does not appear like the same.
 While we must as a matter of course ad
 mit once for all that there are those individuals
 and families, whose standing and reputation
 are such, that they may well defy the "ravag
 es of time and test of ages" to defile or sully
 them—yet, barring these excellent excep
 tions, lamentable indeed to the reformer and
 anxious observer and enquirer after a peo
 ple's destiny—lamentable indeed, we repeal
 with a heart of sorrow, is the moral aspect ol
 society among our people in the confine* ol
 the city of Pittsburg. We assert without
 the fear of successful contradiction ihat the
 morals of the youth here are fifty per ceni.
 worse than ten years ago, and one thousand
 per cent, worse than three years previous
 this is true— ten times worse than three years
 ago*
 A high moral standard and delicate sensi
 bility have yielded to vile influences and
 braving and daring every sense of propriety
 extant in society, the base standard of im
 morality and depravity has been hoisted with
 impunity, around which the thoughtless and
 deluded votaries readily rally. During the
 last winter, we have been informed, that low
 dances, a custom unknown to Pittsburg foi
 the last fourteen years, were common, at
 which many of the young people classed
 among the most favorable portion of society
 were the constant patrons, hailing as fellow
 guests the refuse of the community ming
 ling in their social circle the libertine and
 concubine. Trie strumpet and scoundrel
 stalk abroad with almost unrestricted sway.
 The youth now coming up, especially those
 just emerging into manhood, are fearfully
 delinquent in that which constitutes decency, l
 civility, politeness, and even good manners—
 in all of those traits the prerequisites of a
 good and wholesome state of society.
 Moral and Literary societies arc totally
 neglected by the young people—there not be
 ing such a tiling in existence as a moral or
 literary society among the young men and
 young women of either of the two cities and
 environs. Cadding and gossiping, bending and
 gainsaying, occupying doubtless a much
 higher estimate in their consideration than!
 improvement of the mind and morals. Whatj
 a fearful state of society is this, and yet there
 appear to be no influences at work, either!
 temporal, moral, nor religious—either m the
 church or out of the church brought particu-!
 larly to bear upon it to remedy the evil. That 1
 there is a fault lies some where there is no
 doubt. That parents and leaders in society
 have greatly neglected their duty in many
 particulars we have not a doubt; and call.
 upon them in the name of virtue and rnorali-i
 ty, to look well to the character of the young j
 people. Hut the church stands pre-eminent
 in influence as a body corpoiate among our
 people, and we affirm it to be as much her
 duty to look after the moral as the spiritual
 salvation of a community and we shall here j
 do the present excellent pastors of two of the
 churches the credit—Rev. M. M. Clark, of
 the A. M. E. church in Pittsburg, and Rev.'
 D. Stevens of Wes. church Alleghany, to
 say, that we believe they are willing to and
 would do their duty in this respect, but they
 meet the continual opposition of the profes
 sing leading Christian members of those;
 churches, w ho charge them with “concerning
 themselves too much with the things of the
 world,'' for the very reason that these things
 cannot be reached by preaching, but must be
 done by lecturing —hence, they are told that
 they are out of their sphere, and should they
 persist, run the risk of losing their useful
 ness as ministers of the gospel.
 The Church Herald under the management
 of Rec. A. R. Green as editor, should em
 brace a larger field of usefulness. We hold
 that it is as much the duty of that paper and
 the calling of iis editor to attend to the
 temporal as to the eternal welfare of our peo
 ple—especially here in Pittsburg—right un
 der the eye of the editor and folio of its own
 pages—in the free city of Pittsburg, upon
 subjects and matteis as these most certainly
 are, disconnected with slavery—upon our
 moral elevation and temporal reformation—
 upon the education, morals, manners and
 progress of our people—the colored people
 here in thejcities of Piitsburg and Alleghany,
 the colored people of Alleghany county;
 we say, fora neglect and indifference so pal
 pable as this, the Rev. Augustus R. Green,
 editor of the organ at least of one religious
 sect among the colored people of Alleghany
 county, has not, in our opinion, the shadow
 of a reasonable excuse. Man must become
 moral before he can become religious, and
 genuine Christianity comes by reflection and
 we venture the opinion, that there never was
 a professing Chiistian whose "religion
 stood.” w ho was converted without conviction;
 w inch conviction can only come by reflection
 —indeed it is reflection itself. Bring the
 mind to iniar upon particular wrongs and you
 thus far prepare it for the reception of other
 truths. Man must first be made sensible of
 wrong before he can have a proper conception
 of right Every step to morality and im
 provement is a step gained towards Chris
 tianity, and there is no work more rightfully
 and legitimately that of the minister of the
 gospel than the elevation of man and woman
 temporally, as well as spiritually When the
 time comes that the ministers of the gospel
 generally take a proper interest in the tem
 poral welfare of mankind—then and not tilt
 then, will ihe kingdom ol Chriat which they
 desire to establish, be made fully and effectu
 ally mautfeat among men. M. R. D
Education ia Ohio.
 It is uuly gratifying to observe the awaken
 ing interest everywhere manifested in ihe
 great subject of education among the colored
 people. True, none of those organizations,
 such as the Ohio Slat* School Fund and it*
 auxiliary branches now exist, that were in
 operstton a few years ago. That system—
 good in its anticipated results—laudable in its
 purposes, was suffered to fail from tbe want
 of a ptoper spirit to keep it up. The de
 grading influence of the Black Laws” upon
 colored society m this stale, seemed to hate
destroyed, in a great degree, e*i»n t^u ve
 ambition to become elevated. Thus, after
 abort flickering existence, did almost ere
 ennobling enterprise find au untimely grav
 But

 The last General Assembly, m repeahr
 these lava, greatly removed tbia vile mcubi
 that has borne with such crushing weight upr
 all their efforts to attain an elevated oociai p&lt;
 aition. A pew spirit is now infusing use
 into their every undettaking. Education fir
 presents itself to their immediate consider
 tion. An illustration of this is furnished
 the town of Hamilton. A few years agf
 what was more discouraging then even a
 attempt to sustain a colored school in thi
 community 7 Now, there is a good one 1
 successful operation, with a tolerable chanc
 of iis permanent continuance. On ihe 19t
 inst. I had the satisfaction of being present a
 a Sabbath and afterwards the common schot
 exhibition, the performances of which, b
 unanimous consent, reflect the highest honor
 upon their teacher, Mr. John A. Warren.
 Philadelphia, to whose untiring drvotednes
 this community owes so much.
 The Sabbath school exhibition, which cam
 off first, was a brilliant affair. The littl
 chapel bloomed with becoming decorations
 mostly the work of several married ladies
 I "ho disinterestedly lent their services on ihi
 occasion, and indeed seemed to have out
 stripped the young unmarried ones in th&lt;
 manifestation of deep devotion to the cause
 and their display of a neat delicate taste ii
 fixing up the house. The exercises of tin
 evening lasted until a late hour, and did grea
 j credit to the town, ihe teachers and tin
 scholars.
 Ihe next day, according to previous an
 nouncement, Mr. Warren, with the Sabbatl
 school and his own school children, repairei
 to a thick shady wood, where they lor
 while were left to the enjoyment of thei
 favorite juvenile sports. I almost wished
 wer e a boy again, provided l cr.uld be sur
 j rounded with the same flattering prospects o
 the future. Many children, varying in ag&lt;
 from fifteen to fifty, were also in attendance
 Children J say, for all seemed to have aban
 doned their sedate and sober habits for the
 j and joyous pleasures oi the day. Groups
 scattered here and there over the deep greer
 grass, made the leafy arches ting with thcii
 innocent songs and merry peals of laughter
 Some, with Indian-like devotedness, would
 exercise their skill with bows and arrows,
 others, together with the smallci ones, would
 skip the tope the more settled would wjth
 j draw to sonic deep shade lor the purpose of
 enjoying the more intellectual refreshments tn
 be found in conversation. Recitations, dia
 logues, and a concluding address, brought the
 day’s performances to a close. The whole is
 j deserving of the highest commendation, espe
 cially when the obstacles w hich this gentle
 man has had to encounter arc taken into con
 i "iteration. Nothing like an exhibition was
 ever attempted among the coloted people of
 this place before, and I feel quite assured that
 the whole proceedings resulted to the entire
 satisfaction ot all. That such tilings are de
 cidedly beneficial to school children, is quite
 obvious. They are encouraged hy knowing
 that their labors, if diligent, will be appre
 ciated and iewarded with praises, consequent
 ly they devote themselves more arduously and
 make greater advancement in their studies.—
 There is a great demand for teachers in this
 State, at the present time. It is quite evident
 I that the colored people of Ohio are fast com
 1° a knowledge of the fact, that they are
 responsible, by example and co-operation, for
 *he success o[ all future undertakings affect
 iiJg their general welfare.

Buried Alive.—The Cincinnati Commer
 cial gives the following from a reliable source:
 The body ol a victim of the Cholera was
 placed in the vault of one of our graveyards,
 where it remained about 34 houis, when, in
 the presence of friends and relatives it was
 taken for burial.—Some of the relatives de
 siring to look once more upon the deceased,
 the«exton unscrew ed the coffin, and awful to
 behold, the features of the corpse were found
 to be hideously distorted, his shroud torn,
 and his fingers, which were between his teeth,
 bitten and gnawed to the very bone.
 A Miss Taylor was taken sick with Chol
 era at St Louis on Sunday. It was supposed
 that she had died. Her brother insistdfi that
 she should not be buried until the next day.
 On Monday while tbeluneral preparations
 were in progress, she suddenly revived and
 now bids fair to recover.
 Premature Burial.—A learned Belgian,
 M. Mainple, has recently discovered a very
 simple means of distinguishing between real
 and apparent death. It consists in creating a
 small burn if there is life, a blister is always
 formed even in the absence of apparent sen
 sibility.—lt death has alreadv intervened,
 nothing of the kind occurs.

Aa appeal la bekelf of Ike Western Hew
 York AatMlarery Fait.
 Earnestly desiring the abolition of Slaveii
 in this land, and being deeply convinced thai
 this result can ooly be accomplished by re
 newed efforts to change our present corrupi
 mural sentiment, the underaigned members
 and friends ot ihe Western New York Anti-
 Slavery S*meiv. again, make their appeal to
 the frienda of the Slave in behalf U ihe:r
 annual Bazaar, which will be he'd in Roches
 ter in December neat.
 While »e have been cheered and gladden
 ed by the progress already made, and ihe
 good already done, and while we rejoice to
 observe that fnends have been raised up to
 plead the cause of the bondman among per
 sons, and in quarters where we had least ex
 pected them, we still see “the harvest to be
 great and thejia&amp;orers to be few,” and instead of
 relaxing our effort we are impressed with a
 sense of the duty of doubling our diligence,
 ami applying more closely our eneigies to
 the means of advancing this holy cause.—
 We appeal the more boldly to oar fnends
 because thuoe tor whom we plead caneot plead
 for themselves. While we are surrounded
 by our domestic circle, with none to Xuiesi or
 make us affraid, there are three w::iions of
 men and women m our own land, doomed to
 abject slavery and chains, robbed of every
 right—civil—social—personal —and political.
 Remembering those in bonds as Itound w ith
 them, we desire to plead their cause as though
 the galling chain were on our own limbs and
 the knotted lash were applied to our own
 backs.
 While to obtain means for enlightening the
 public mind, is the strong motive for holding
 our annual Fair, it is not the only one A
 gTeat amount of good may lie traced directly
 to such occasions. Many who are now active
 workers in behalf of this holy movement be
 came first interested in it through the instru
 mentality of those annual exhibitions, of
 anti-slavery industry, tact and skill.
 The present object of the Rochester anti
 slavery Bazaar is for the general enlighten
 ment of the public mind on the subject ot
 slavery. Recognizing the North Siat, (pub
 lished in this city) as an efficient Anti-Slave
 ry instrumentality, we propose that the funds
 raised bv ihe Sale of articles at the Bazaar
 (on behalf of which we here appeal) shall
 be mainly appropriated to the support of that
 important p-ipei.
 We gratefully acknowledge ihe prompt
 assistance rendered to our last Fair by our
 friends and coadjutors in various pans of our
 own State, Wisconsin, and Michigan and we
 earnestly solicit tlnr continued co-operation
 with us in the good work. That no time
 may lie lost, we especially recommend to
 them the immediate formation of sewing cir
 cles in heir various towns with u view to
 making articles for the Rochester Bazaar.
 We would also in this connection render our
 heartfelt thanks to our British friends for the
 valuable aid extended by them to our last
 year’s Fair and we would again warmly so
 licit their generous assistance. It is due our
 trails-Atlantic friends to say tliap, for much of
 the interest felt m our last Bazaar we were
 indebted to them, and we arc pursuaded that
 their continued co-operatiori will essentially
 promote the success of our approaching De
 cember Bazaar, and the advancement of the
 cause of the slave in our land.
 We hope that the foregoing appeal will
 commend itself to our philanthropic friends
 on both sides the Atlantic, and that thev will
 cordially unite with us in the effort here pro
 posed

 Appeal of the Philadelphia Association
 The Women’s Association of Philadel
 phia,” appeal to a benevolent public, and to
 ihe friends of the Slave everywhere, to aid
 them in their approaching Fair, the object cl
 which is to sustain the North Star.’ To
 those who are familiar w ith the pages of this
 paper it is unnecessary to speak of its merit,
 lo those who have not seen it we may say,
 that we regard it as one of the very best anti
 slavery instrumentalities now in the field.
 We are the more interested in it, because
 the editor is one of our own oppressed race,
 md admirably qualified by Ins talents and
 moral worth to perforin w ith credit the ardu
 ous task of editing a paper devoted to our ele
 vation. We believe and trust that onr friends
 will give us their liberal aid.
 To our ow n people we look earnestly and
 hopefully. Sisters, brothers, shall we look
 in vain? The iron has entered into your souls.
 \e go heavily, bowed down to the very dust,
 dispirited, crushed by the weight of oppres
 sion. Ye hear the taunts ol the enemy, “They
 are so ignorant and unrefined' They are
 jealous one of another' Yes, they unite but
 it is only to put down one who is more intel
 lectual than the mass Prove by ihe uner
 ring language of conduct that these assertions
 so often thrown in our faces are malicious
 slanders. Sustain F. Douglass, because hit
 talents and correct principles demand your
 respect and confidence. Sustain him because
 it is right to do so. and because of the sweet
 peace the performance of $o worthy an action
 will assuredly bring into your own bosom.
 The Fair will be held on Christmas week.
