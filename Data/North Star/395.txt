 t kamck —The chief subject of discussion
 it, the National Assembly, lias been the re
 port of M. Thtets on the Roman question.
 R is said to be decidedly conservative, and at
 ♦anance with the expressed views of the
 President. The conclusion at which M
 Thiers arrives is, that liberal inetitutions are
 incompatible with the independence of the
 Pope as a temporal sovereign, and likewise
 the independence of the Catholic Church, and
 ,vtieri the rights of the people are at issue,|the
 latter ought to give way. It is supposed that
 the views of M. Thiers w ill not Ire responded
 to by the French nation. At a Ministerial
 Council held subsequently to the delivery of
 ot the report, it wa.-&gt; decided that the govern
 ment would follow the policy laid down in the
 President’s letter on the affairs ol Rome.
 The effect of this, it is supposed wil l
 be the immediate resignation of M. Falloux
 and Gen. Ruilhieres. No action had ta
 ken place on the pari of ihe Assembly,
 to indicate the views of the majority on
 ihe report ol M. 'Thiers.
 On the 19th, during the speech of M. de la
 Kosaiere on the Roman question, an altercation
 arose between M. M. Thiers and Bisco. The
 latter declared that the former had said that
 the election of Louis Napoleon would be a
 disgrace to France. Thiers demanded satis
 uction, and a duel took place at once. One
 shot was fired by each at 20 paces distance,
 but neither was wounded, and the seconds
 came forward and said the parties had done all
 that honor required. Both members returned
 to the Assembly just as the. sitting had ad
 journed, at 6.
 A sensation has been caused in Paris by an
 announcement that the basis of an alliance be
 tween England and France on the Turkish
 question had been agreed to
 The High Court of Justice at Versailles
 commenced its sittings on the 13th, and is at
 present engaged in trying the persons concern
 ed with the affairs of the 13th July Several
 disreputable scenes have occurred befoie the
 Court. On the 13th ult-, when M
 Emile de Girardin., was being examined as a
 witness, a violent altercation took place be
 tween him and the Procureur General, in the
 course of which M. Girardin declared that the
 Constitution having been violated, resistance,
 was a duty.
 At a subsequent stage of the examination,
 the judge forbade M. Girardin to reply to a
 temarkofone of the counsel, w hen all the pris
 oners arose, eu nidsse, and demanded that the
 witness should be heard. A fearful scene of
 lumult and confusion ensued, and nearly an
 hour elapsed before the hissings could bring
 the accused and the Judge to a state ot calm
 ness
 On the day following, one ol the witnesses,
 lieutenant of gendarmerie, boasted ot hav
 ing thtusted his sabre into the breast ot a man
 who was unarmed, whereupon all the accused
 lost up and denounced the witness as a cow
 *id indescribable confusion ensued, which
 terminated in the judges taking flight.
 The Ecenement says, that the Russian
 Charge d’Affairs had told a foreign Minister
 ihat Russia would regard as a declaration of
 war the entrance ot a French fleet into the
 Dardanelles. The same journal is assured
 that orders have been given to the f rench
 fleet to join the English fleet at Naples

 There hag been a misunderstanding between
 vne of the Cardinals and M. de Corceliee.
 The Frenchman being offended at a letter ie
 carved from the ecclesiastic, complains ol the

 A letter dated Oct. Ithb, says, that the;
 Austrian tGeneral Kantian had arrived at
 Widdin, with a letter from Uen. Havnau to
 the Pasha, by which the Hungarian refugees
 from the sergeant downwards, are anested
 in consequence of which the greater part ofi
 them returned to Hungary Several hundred
 officers of those furnished with passports
 from Comorn have passed through Berlin on

 hundred others, are said to have resolved on

 Russia and Turkey —There is no later
 new’s from Constantinople or St. Petersburgh;
 consequently no accounts of the solution of the
 difficulty between the Turk and the Czar.
 The general belief, however, among well in
 formed circles is said 10 be thai Russia will
 pocket the affront, rather than provoke a col
 lision with the governments of England and
 France.
 A correspondent of the European Tunes,
 w riting Irom Belgrade, states fliat the Hunga
 rian refugees still remain at Widdin. They
 are divided into three camps Italian, Hunga
 rian, and Polish. Beni, Dembmski, and some
 twenty other officers, besides enbiacing Islam*
 ism, had entered the Turkish army.
 Prince Alexander of Servia, is said to have
 behaved well towards the refugees, allowing

 Western Mew York Annual AnthSlave
 ry Fair at Rochester.
 This fair will be opened the I bib of Janua
 ry next, instead of December, as has been be
 fore contemplated and published. The post
 ponement will doubtless meet the approval of
 all concerned. We shall need more time for
 preparation, as the old articles are nearly all
 disposed of, and this year we must have an
 entire new stock We hope there are already
 many sewing circles formed in different parts,
 who are zealously engaged in making up the
 £rt?at variety of useful and beautiful articles,
 :hat are usually presented at our fair. We
 isk every abolitionist, and every friend of the
 :ause in this Stale especially, as w r ell a 3
 iiends in every other State, to feel themselves
 bound to be represented, either personally or
 by donation, at the Rochester Fair Let none
 feel themselves excused from laboring earnest
 y to make this Anti-Slavery Fair worthy of
 :he cause.
 Some of our warm hearted European
 friends, have already prepared and forwarded
 r box of articles to aid us iu this movement.
 Truly, their disinterestedness and devotedness
 rught to tinge every slaveholder’s cheek with
 ihaine—stir every northern abettor’s bean
 with remorse, ajid stimulate every abolitionist
 to double zeal. The North Star we intend to
 lustain, and we ask the zealous eo-operatioi
 of our friends in so doing. Lectures are much
 ■eeded, and in this section of the State there
 is a wide field for profitable exertion.
 Seed diligently sown will yield a hundred
 or a thousand fold, and the bread of truth east
 upon the waters will return after many days
 The personal attendance of anti-slavery friendf
 at the fair is earnestly solicited, and confident
 ly anticipated, and we trust that we shall be
 able to make it more woithy the patronage o
 the community than any that has preceded it

 To the Friends of the Slave and of
 the. North Star.
 Leak Friends —The North Star is uov
 near the close of its second year, and finds it
 self in debt, its self-sacrificing Editor ha;
 struggled on, by day and by night, at boon
 and abroad, to sustain it and the cause it ad
 vocates, without drawing anything from th&lt;
 pioceeds of the paper for his own support
 He cannot make the paper what it would be
 ifheeould be constantly at his post. Necessity
 has compelled him to be much from home ii
 order to extend its circulation. Many of yoi
 may not be awaie of the expense k incident t&lt;
 the publication of a paper and many havi
 supposed that the North Star was sustaining
 itself and making its owner a profilabh
 business but, 1 can assure you it is far other
 wise, and that few refmm papers can be sus
 tained by their subscription lists, at least a
 their commencement: and th«-y do not have i
 long advertising patronage, as most of th&lt;
 political papers have. Now I would ask thi
 friends of the Slave, and the friends of Fred
 enck Douglass, if it is tight foi ns to suffe;
 him thus to struggle on single handed in th&lt;
 cause for which we all profess to feel so much
 For one, i feel that it is not right, and as out
 means of aiding him and bis paper, 1 would
 propose ihai each subscriber send on the
 amount of his subscription for the next year
 with an additional dollar aaa donation, and l hal
 each endeavor to procure at least one additional
 subscriber. This, 1 believe, would put the

The Iron, and Iron Hearted City.
 Dear Feiesu Dovsuw —I *ro wjouming
 in tbit “liron" —(I wat goiug to say Iron
 Hearted “City") lot the present. Perbape
 tbe latter adjective would be ihepgat appro
 priate, as well as the most significant, for the
 mate of the people here, are at iron-hearted
 as the iron they manufacture, so far aa any
 sympathy for humanity or reform is concern
 ed. Indeed, it cannot be wondered, and per
 haps they ought not to be blamed that such is
 the case lor life to them is but a battle for
 money and bread. The rattle of dtajs, and
 wagons,—the uproar and tumult—the borry
 mg to and fro w hich are to be seen and heard
 on all sides, are but so many discordant notes
 of muss- to this ceaseless war of trade and
 traffic. ’Tis true there aie a few good spirits
 here a few whose souls are sadly out of
 place, and out of harmony in this mighty
 struggle. They feel that whatever may be
 the professions of a people thus grasping, thus
 engaged and absorbed their practices
 sre “of the earth, earthly" —that to them
 Truth, Goodness, Righteousness and Free
 dom, are matters of incidental importance, are
 mere abstractions, which are very pretty to
 talk about, but impossible to practice.
 There has occasionally been a momentary
 interest excited here, in behall of the great
 question of Freedom—in interest which man
 ifests considerable earnestness for a time—but
 soon the subject is forgotten, and the cry of
 perishing myriads is dtowned by the uproar
 and clatter of money-getting. So lung as so
 ciety is now organized, perhaps it will be ne
 cessary to make accumulation, the paramount
 object—the “chief end ol man." It is truly
 demeaning to make this the highest object ol
 life —to cultivate that faculty, so much to &lt;he
 neglect ®f the higher and nobler attnbutes ot
 the soul; but the people must have bread,
 and while the few infernal graboerals and mo
 nopolists have all the bread and money, of
 course the many must work, and suffei and
 toil, or surtender and die. Few are disposed
 to do the latter, and therefore submit to the
 crushing, blinding, stultifying, influences that
 surround them
 It is not extenuating the matter to say there
 are upwards of one hundred churches m this
 city. Indeed, this is perhaps the saddest
 shade in the picture. It goes to show the ut
 ter inhumanity of a religion so extensively
 preached—so widely professed. Such a reli
 gion adapts itself very readily to -the times
 and is very profitable and convenient to the
 priesthood; but Humanity must tide over ii
 and its temples, before she can be free. Re
 formers will ever find the most virulent oppo
 sition, the greatest amount of calumny and
 odium coming from this source, l.et Human'
 jtv rejoice then, whenever there are indications
 ol the fall and failure of the churches, for
 when they are superseded, hei redemption
 draweih nigh.

 will be glad to aid me in accomplishing an
 important work ir, this place. 1 have resolved
 to erect a Free Presbyterian Church. Some
 loity or fifty members of rny old congregation
 will go with me.—Those members who re
 main, refuse to let us worship in the house
 we left at any hour of th« .Sabbath, although n
 may not he occupied by any other person. I
 feel that the Church of God must be aroused
 to take hold of the question of freedom,
 with more earnestness and energy than it has
 ever vet done, or the great wheels of the
 chariot of liberty will be clogged. 1 do not
 know any rpason why the central part ot
 Ohio is not a favorable position for exerting
 an influence favorable to ibis object. I am l
 willing to make the experiment. The friends
 of the congregation who go with me are con- j
 tribuling liberally, according to their ability,
 i But we will need some foreign aid to complete
 our undertaking. I would be glad to see i
 many of my distant Anti-Slaveiy brethren
 face to face, and present my plea persor.r.lly.

A "Negro Commentator. —The following I
 story, furnished by the Alabama correspon
 dent of the Manchester American, shows how
 the slaves in that legion come by their know
 ledge of the Bible, and bow very accurate
 and valuable ibat knowledge is. It would be
 the height of folly, however, to expect any
 thing better of those in whom the ability to
 read is looked upon as a crime
 As the negroes learn nothing from books,,
 their knowledge ot tho Bible and of history,
 even among the most intelligent is extremely
 limited and imperfect, abounding in odd
 w hims and strange enors. We once atten
 ded a large meeting of ihe colored people, ad
 dressed by a colored preacher, who of course
 could neither read nor write. It was his
 custom not to take any particular passage for
 a text, but to relate unne incident of the
 Scripture, according to'the best of his recol
 lection, and then add such explanations ol
 his own as might occur to him. On this oc
 casion he selected the visit ol Nicodeuius,
 as the foundation of h*3 observations,.

 times a great manv preachers on de atth who

 Rhode Island Ante-Slavery Society—
 Annual Meeting.
 The fourteenth annual meeting ol the Rhode
 Island Anti-SlaTery Society, will be heW a»
 Mechanic's Hall. Providence, on Wednesday
 and Thursday. Nov. Hth and l&gt;th, lit!*.
 Prominent advocates of emancipation—«~t-bracing
 bracing several w ho have broken the chains of
 slavery, and arc breatbiag the free air of Heav
 en, tn defiance of Southern laws—have beeu
 invited to be present, and will, it is expected,
 give valuable ani to our own earnest laborers,
 in making the meeting an interesting and pro
 fitable one to all who shall deem it worthy of
 thetr piesence.
 Much has been done for our cause during
 the jiast year, bttt much yet remains for such
 to do as are not mob weary wait dumg well.
 The geographical boundaries of slavery tn oui
 own country have been fixed by the public
 voice, and cannot, it is confidently believed,
 be earned further from the centre of our ini
 quity. But it remains to blot out the loul
 slain where it already exists, and to hasten
 the glad hour when the angel of Time shall
 say, “Thus tar hast thou come out no far
 ther." To this end we invite the old and tbe
 young, the strong, the feeble, ihe confident,
 the desponding, and the faithless, to meet
 with us, at our annual gathering, and
 share in our hopes, our encouragements, our
 joys, and our labors

An Appeal In behalf ol the Western
 New Vork Auti-Slavpry Fair.
 Earnestly desiring the abolition of Slavery
 hi this land, and being deeply convinced that
 this result can only be accomplished by renew
 ed efforts to change our present corrupt moral
 sentiment, the undersigned members and
 friends of the Western New Vork Anti-slavery
 Society, again make their appeal to the
 friends of the Slave in behalf of their annual
 Bazaar, Ahirh will he held in Rochester on
 the IHth of January, lfciiO.
 While we have been cheered and gladdened
 by the progress already made, and the good
 alteadv done, and while we rejoice to observe
 that friends have been raised up to plead the
 cause of the hondmaii among persons, and in
 quarters w here we had least expected them,
 we still see the “harvest to bo great and the
 laborers to be few,*’ and instead of relaxing
 our efforts, we are impressed with a sense of
 the duty of doubling our diligence, and ap
 plying more closely our energy to the means
 of advancing this holy cause.—We appeal the
 more boldly to our friends because those for
 whom we plead cannot [dead for themselves.
 While we are surrounded by our domestic
 circle, with none to molest or make us afraid, i
 tlmre are three millions of men and women in
 our own land, doomed to abject Slavery and
 chains, robbed of every right—civil—social—
 personal—and political. Remembering those
 in bonds as bound with them, we desire to j
 plead their cause as though they were on our
 ow n limbs, and the knotted lash were applied
 to our own backs.
 While to obtain means tor enlightening the
 public mind, is the strong motive for holding
 our annual Fair, it is not the only one. A
 great amount of good may be traced directly
 to such occasions. Many who are now ac
 tive workers in behalf of this holy movement
 became first interested in it through the in- 1
 strumeiitality of those annual exhibitions of
 anti-slavery industry, tact and skill.
 The present object of the Rochester anti
 slavery Bazaar is for the general enlighten
 ment of the public mind on the subject ofsla
 very. Recognizing the North Star, (published
 in this city) as an efficient Anti-Slavery in
 strumentality, we propose that the funds raised
 by the Sale of articles at the Bazaar (on
 behalf of which we here appeal) shall be 1
 mainly appropriated to the support of that j
 important paper.
 We gatefully acknowledge the prompt as-
 sistance rendered to our last hair by our
 friends anil coadjutors in various parts of our
 own State, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and we
 earnestly solicit their continued co-operation
 with us in the good wotk. 1 hat no time may
 be lost, we especially recommend to them the
 immediate formation of sewing circles in their
 various towns with a view to making aiticies
 for the Rochester Bazaar. We would also
 in this connection render our heartfelt thanks
 to our British friends for the valuable aid ex
 i tended by them to our last year’s Fair arid
 I we would again warmly solicit their generous
 assistance. It is due to our trans-Atlantic
 friends to say that for much of the interest felt
 in our last Bazaar we were indebted to them,
 and we are persuaded that their continued
 co-operation will essentially piomote the suc
 cess of our approaching -December Bazaar,
 and the advancement of the cause of the slave
 in our land.
 We hope that the foregoing appeal will
 commend itself to out philanthropic friends on
 both sides of the Atlantic, and that they will
 cordially unite with us in the effott here pro
 posed
