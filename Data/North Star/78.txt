 The undersigned, at a public meeting of
 citizens of Boston, held at Fuuenil Hall, on
 in relation to the recent arrest,
 at VV asliingtim, ot' threi men, charged with
 awisting the e.v’ap jof fugitive slaves, were
 authon/.iid to collect money and employ coun
 sel, for the purpose of defending these men,
 and of bringing before the Supreme Court of
 the United States the question of tlia legality
 of slavery in the District of Columbia.
 Our action in this matter can furnish no col
 or of pretence to charge us with meddlesome
 inteitpreuce. Whatever may lie the case in
 the States, slavery in the District of. Columbia
 is a national affair our affair. Over that
 District Congress possesses sole and exclu
 sive jurisdiction. It is the citizens of the
 United States who are tber jailors of
 men.
 We deny that the Constitution confers on
 Congress any power to establish, or to main
 tain slavery, tu territory over which it possess
 es exclusive jurisdiction. This is a most im
 portant question, in reference not only to the
 Jbstrict of Columbia, lnit to tlm territory
 about to be acquired from- Mexico. We w ish
 to bring it before tin* Supreme Court, and to
 have w&gt; presented there, along with some
 other closely related questions, by the very
 ablest counsel. To do that, money is needed
 and wc call on you, friends of liberty, to fur

 .Say» a biographer of Lafayette:
 For the purpose of applying bin priori
 |des to mm ol color, he purchased a pjanta
 ti-»!i |;i l r i c'i pniaiia. ilia first step was t»
 coflerf affifie whips and other instruments o
 torture aid ptnt*!iWtrt, and tank-* a bonfire o
 them, in pre«s(»ce *»f the assembled slave*.—
 Ho th n instituted a plan «.f giiintr a portior
 of his time to each every week, with a pro
 mi# tual aatoyn as auy ooehad earned monet
 enough to ptirebaec aa additional day of the
 week, he should I*e entitled to it; aud ht
 should have tint and feo on, until ho w ni
 master of bit* w hole time. In the then state
 &lt;»f Anti-Slavery this gradintl and
 sifting process was denned norcssarr to form
 the cinr.icter of slaves, and to secure the
 «fc«y of tltc masters. Abolitionists would
 i n elect this inode now. They would turn
 slavrts at once into free hdiorors, or lease
 holders, on the same estate, if possible, w here
 they had been as glares. Hull, thore is not
 an American afxditisuist who would not nc
 joice to sec n single Southern planter ropy
 I the plan qf Lafaywtte, or take any other step
 tending to emancipation, however remote.-
 Before liaTayette'g views were fuljyexocutcd,
 the french resolution occurred, which inter
 rupted his operations, and made tho slaves
 free at onoe. But mark the conduct of the
 r ungrateful and Mood-thirsty Mark*. "While
 other slaves in the colony availed themselves
 ol th j first moment of ftcedoas to quit the
 plantations of their masters, Lafayette's re
 mained, desiring to work for their humane
 and generous friend.”
 ‘•Jle was then also a member of the French
 Abolition Society called the Amisdea Noirs,
 the Friends of the Blacks.
 It was at this tune that the Revolution in
 Ifayti occurred. lie was then a member of
 th National and in this body ho
 was among tl;= foremost in behalf of the.
 slaves and the free colored people of that
 Island, voting not only for the immediate abo
 lition of slavery, but lor granting to all of the
 colored people rights equal to and in" common
 with the white people. Ho was also in fimir
 ol alt tlm-e-just measures in relation to Hayti
 which our modetu republicans have slan
 derously reported as being fraught with the
 horrors rtf' St. Domingo abolition.’ Those
 horrors’ were not the result of abolition, hut
 ol an attempt to. enslave them after they had
 once by the government bee* set free. La
 fayette must not only bear the odium in this
 country of having snid that he would not liave!
 fought for slavery, but also of precipitating
 th revolution, the Moody revolution pf Si. r
 Domingo. It was resistance to Liberty
 tint drew that blood from the veins uF tire!
 planters.
 After the surrender of Cornwallis, in'
 which campaign lie bore sonic conspicuous
 part, lie was complimented by the State of Yir-,
 uinia, w ho had reaped the fruits of his suc
 cesses, and he replied, by the expression that
 liberty might he speedily extended to all men,
 without distinction.
 “After lie had returned to France, and had
 seen with pride the growing prosperity of this
 country, and with sadness bis own nation
 sinking hack from republicanism into the arms
 of monarchy half smothering the intima
 tion that European emancipation frtim kingly
 power had failed through American apostacy
 I and refusal to giant omaueipaiioa to her slaves
 —lie says:
 VVhile indulging in my views of.
 can prospects, and American Lihoyty, it is
 mortifying to.!x- told that ill that very country
 a large |*ortion of tl;c pctqile aTC slaves'! It:
 is a dark spot on the face of tiie nation. Such
 a state of things casmot always exist. I* «ee
 in the papers that there w u jdan of gradual
 abolition of slavery in the District of Colum
 bia. I w ould bo doubly happy of it, for the
 measure hi itself and because asci.se of Ame
 rican pride makes me recoil at the observa
 tions of the diplomatist. and other foreigners,
 who gladly improve the unfortunate existing
 circumstances into a general objection to our
 republican, and (saving that deplorable evil,)
 our matchless system.’
 Cut rage.
 Mr. Wrn. Daily, one of the most respect
 able colored cilizms of Richmond, who has
 resided some time m Liberia, but within the
 last three years returned;to America, a short
 portiui of which lime lut hue sjxmii in Rich
 mond, the place of his birth, aud residence of
 his time and care-worn parents, was, a few
 days since, arrested for no other criitie than
 being found upon the soil eti which lie
 breathed his first infant breath, aud required
 to give security willdu five days, to leave the
 state in ten, or remain iu prison until he was
 able to leave. But peiad venture he should
 not be able to pay his jail fees, according to
 the w isdom of Virginia law-makers, he must
 be wild from the auction block, to the highest
 bidder; and there arc not a few cases on!
 record w here like victim* have become slaves
 for life.
 What a glutmus commentary upon tl»e pro
 fessedly institutions of Republican A
 mcrica! One bieezc heaves upon bosom
 the w arm, generous and enthusiastic shout ol
 sympathy in behalf of the comparative free
 men of Kurope in their struggles for man

ROCHKSTKR, MAY 12, 1848.
CIfILLICOTUE, April 20, 1348.
 Dear Douglass r I arrived here frotr
 Columbus to-day, after holding two meeting*
 among the c dored citizens alone,having vainly
 endeavored to effect a meeting among the
 citizens of the place generally. When upon
 the evo of leafing, I was informed by a gen
 tleman, tli,it provided I staid another day, a
 meeting could be effected. Hut my time be
 ing precious, and having already spent suffi
 cient in the place, I could not consent. I am
 of opinion, that the failure in the first place
 was more the effect of timidity on the part ol
 the applicants than anything else.
 For 'want of room in my last, I omitted to
 mention some incidents peculiar to the Na
 tional Road, which came under my notice,
 travelling from Lloydsville to Columbus.—
 \Y hen I arrived at Cambridge, having stopped
 at the Temj er-nce House,*’kept by Mr.
 Carey, and the only Anti-Slavery hotel on
 that rood, I was requested to «op and lecture
 that evening. It being on the Sabbath day, I
 was requested by the officiating Methodist
 clergyman, who sent for me to call at the
 church to see him, who proposed, after the
 sermon, to give me an opportunity to speak to
 the people. Hut this I decliuedi for two
 •reasons one, that I desired to get on to Con
 cord, to hold a meeting there that eveuing,
 consequently could not take time to refresh
 the other, that however much I-may have
 been inclined to speak, I should not hare
 availed myself of suehan opportunity, ts, at
 best, religious meetings are the most unfa
 vorable to lecture before on the subject of
 slavery; and,still more so, immediately after
 a sermon, and that, too, a funeral sermon, as
 was the case in this instance. For me to
 have attempted to expose the hypocrisy of
 pro-slavery religion, by rebuking the infernal
 system of American slavery, as I most as
 suredly would have done, before such a con
 gregation, and at snob a time, would have
 been a sin unpardonable.
 Cambridge is the place in which that
 fearless advocate of human rights, M. R.
 Hull, was shamefully and basely mobbed
 e/rr n times, and finally, being unable to bear
 the continued heavy loss consequent from such
 attacks upon his property, was driven to Con
 cord, a lew mile* west. Although I have
 spoken in many of the most pro-slavery pla
 ecs since I have been in tins State, even
 where there had never before been an Anti-
 Slavery lecture, yet, at the most shameful
 treatment received by Hull, I felt so indig
 nant, that I would not speak m the place. 1
 was entreated hv the few unti-slavcry friends
 there tn stay and liold a meeting, but per
 emptorily refused. In this I may have been
 wrong, and if so, plead guilty to the charge,
 hut could not at the time persuade myself
 that there was ajiy duty iixumbeut on me
 as it appeared to me, that those that are
 righteous, shall be righteous still,” and as to
 the others, they were given over to a hard
 ness of heart.*’ I went on to Concord, but
 held no meeting in consequence of the ab
 sence of Mr. Hull. Saw his wife, but did
 not make myself known to her.' The people
 of Concord whom I conversed whh, though
 evidently anti-mobocratic in feeling and prin
 ciple, yet appeared as little concerned about
 anti-slavery as they were about the piracy on
 the Northern coast of Africa.
 Although I have met with enough to rebuke
 in almost every place I have visited, yet have
 never met, nor did I eijn-ct to meet, with any
 thing like the miserable truckling to the slave
 power, and low servility manifested at most
 litery bouse upon the rued, and in every town
 ihrough which I passed. Indeed, I cannot
 permit mvself to believe that there is in either
 Asia or Africa, short of the most eon&amp;uin
 raati ly ignorant, and degradedly barbarous, a
 ribc or clan of heathen that can ho found*
 imong whom a stronger, of whatever nation
 &gt;r clime, would not meet with more rniiny,
 ban a colored person—-at least than I received
 from Lloydsville to Zaneeriilu upon this “Ne
 :iuual Road, and that, too, a road which is
 me of the greatest highway thoroughfares in
 lie country —a thtewaghfare along which
 pwqde of all kinds and grades are continually
 passing. There in a manifest depravity on
 its part of many of the people in this country,
 s hicb, if it be not speedily remedied, ViU as
 now apparent militate greatly to lb© delx&gt;
 nent of the National prosperity. It is tae

 1 would simply observe to the friends e
 humanity who uny pass alone this read, hot!
 1 Colored and white, that our frumd Carey, ii
 Cambridge, keep* an Anti-Slavery and Tern
 poranoe hotel, directly opposite the stngi
 (twee, and his friends greatly'complain, am
 nhat,‘too, not wrtlioot a jdst cause, that anti
 sherry men frequently pass through Cam
 bridge in private vehicles, and plop at pro
 slavery houses instead of his. Of tins kiudo
 preference,. there perhaps are none ssure cul
 pablc than the colored people who reside it
 the surrounding neighborhood, who frequently
 ride to town on the Sabbaah, none of when
 ever as yet hare patronised his house, aithougl
 they are aware that it is art anti-rlavefy ant
 temperance house, patonizing the pro-slavcrj
 house in preference, the inmates aqd pioprio
 tors of whom even sneer at them oo their ap
 proach, and care nothing more about itherr
 thau their money is concerned. I hold it tc
 be a boundcu duty for anti-slatery and tern
 pciancc men and women to support anti-sla
 very a«»d temperance houses, in preference tc
 any other. r
 Friday evening, the 21st, delivered a lec
 ture before the colored citizens, in the African
 M. E. Church, on the subject of our moral
 elevation, laying the claims of the North Star
 before them. On Saturday evening, I lec
 tured again in the same church, and on Sab
 bath accompanied a largo number of males
 and females to the Uniontownship Settle
 ment,” nine miles from CkiKicothe, and lec
 ttired to a very large assemblage of respeeta-
 I bio colored farmers, in the colored Baptist
 Church, holding another mcetingon the same
 evening two and a half miles distant, in a
 Methodist Church. Monday, 23d, lectured
 in the Colored Methodist Church, Chiilicoihe;
 and on Tuesday evening in Frankfort, 12
 miles west of Cbillicothe. On Wednesday,
 2Gth, lectured again to a crowded house, in
 the llapiist Clutch, which closed uiy meet
 ings for the present in this region. J
 I. could not succeed in obtaining a church
 here to lecture in, so utterly indifferent arc the
 Christians here to the cries of the groaning
 millions m the land. There is, notwithstand
 ing, a desided ohange in the general character
 of the dominant people of Chillicothc—l mean
 the w hites. Four years ago, like most of
 places, so servile wcie the people here, that
 a strange colored person was scarcely per
 mitted to pass without ridicule and insult.—
 Nay, you could not make inquiry at the post
 office without meeting insult from its clerks;
 and, indeed, this species of petty despotism
 was dealt out toward the colored citizens of
 the? place, as well as strangers. But now,
 there is generally that kind of courtesy and
 civility manifested towards one, by those with
 whom he may have dealings, that become peo
 ple professing to be Christians. One may
 now pass along the streets, and enter the post
 office or a hotel, without incurring insult at
 the threshhold at least.]
 There aie quite a number of respectable
 colored mechanics in Chillicothc, all industri
 ously employed also a large number of free
 holders and more farmers round about in this
 neighborhood than I have ever yet met with.
 This is highly creditable to the colored in
 habitants, and will do more towards elevating
 us, than all other human efforts this of
 Mason and Dixon's line.
 1 would observe that altogether the young
 society in this place is not quite so commend
 able nowr as when I visited here four years
 since. There are some most excellent excep
 tions to this but there is great room in gen
 eral for improvement. There does not appear
 to be the general intelligence here now that
 there was then, though the manner in which
 they, as well as the old people, crowded(othc
 churches, attentively listening to discourses
 upon their moral elevation, certainly mani
 fested the greatest desire to gaia information.
 There are now oo good schools—indeed, no
 school at all for colored youth in Chillicothe;
 and upon the heads of the authors of the
 abominable Black Laws let the execrations of
 outraged humanity rest. If should be borne in'
 mind that all the schools, or nearly so, aiuoug
 the colored people of Ohio, are supported at
 their own private expense, while they are
 shamefully and tyrannically compelled to pay
 taxes for the education of the whites.
 There are some rare spirits among the
 young men and women, who are endeavoring'
 to get an efficient library, to supply themi
 with useful information, and improve their!
 time and talents. I have appointed here, as
 in Columbus, male and female agencies for!
 the North Star.
 Of those ladies and gentlemen who render
 me service, I will writo more particularly i
 hereafter. I leave in the mo rum g, a route
 for Cincinnati.
 Yours for God and humanity,
 M. R. I&gt;.

 Mr. Clarke is one of that faithful band of
 I Mafisacliusetls clergymen, ready and zealous
 to do their duly on the great question of
 American slavery. Some five or six years
 since, I remember bis preaching in Boston,
 at the Pitt Street chapel, when the claims of
 the suffering bondmen received legitimate
 attention. It was much more of a cross then,
 thair it is now; still he shrunk not, but re
 membered those in bonds, as bound with
 them. lie has from that time to the present
 manifested a warm desire for the elevation of
 the nominally free colored man; and on one
 occasion, w hen solicited to address one of
 their societies in Boston, he promptly res
 ponded, assuring them that it afforded him
 more heartfelt satisfaction to appear before
 that body, than if he had been the recipient
 of a large sum of money for lecturing before
 the societies of the more favored in the com
 munity. The Committee of correspondence
 did not fail to circulate tlio gratifying intelli
 gence among the colored people aud their
 friends, whose grateful hearts yet love to
 refer to the noble offering.—w. c. n.

 feasmuck as they are what they pretend ro he,

extract trots s Sermon,
 Preathtd at Tray, X. 1", tn a company »f Mr. Grr
 rti Smith's Grantees, mi the ere of their departure tn
 their lands, by Henry Highland Gurnet, Pastor a)
 the liberty street Church.
 Isaiah, 57 Chap., 13,14. Ife that put
 tetli his trust in mo, shall pnssass the land.
 Cast ye npcast yo up, prepare the wav,
 take up the stumbling block out of tiie way
 of my people.”
 The first great duty of man is to honor the
 living God. For this he has all the necessa
 ry capacities. He is endowed with thought,
 and affection, and the one is capable of being
 turned lovingly upon the Lord, and the other
 can be improved illimiubiy.
 And there is another duty which a righte
 ous man will perforin. Ho will labor to pro
 mote the happiness of his brethern of the hu
 man family to remove if possible, the sor
 rows that may gather around them to wipe
 away the tears from thoir eves; to soothe
 their aching hearts, and to lead them by pre
 cept, and example to the bosom of die univer
 sal Father.
 Iliere is yet another great duty devolving
 upon men a duty which the majority of man
 kind place first upon the list a reyn-d for
 one’s own happiness. This blessing so eager
 ly sought, but which is so seldom found, can
 only be secured by the discharge of tl»e two
 former duties. Love to God and man, opens
 the road to happiness. Love asrl obedience
 united, produce this happy state of mind. He
 who Uvea the holiest life, enjoys the happiest
 spirit; so it has been since men or angels
 have had being, and so it ever will be. He
 who loves God, and his fellow men, receives
 the approbation of Jehovah, and his conscience
 is the witness. Perfect love flows from the
 heart in several directions, and like a stream
 from the brain, of a mountain, it gladdens every
 spot through which it flows. It prepares us
 to maintain all the relations of life. We be
 come faithful patriots, friends, brothers, com
 panions, parents and Christians.
