 THE WATEIt-CtlBE.
 The Hydropathic treatment, orappli
 cation of water ns a powerful and *uc
 ceasful agent in the cure of many of tht
 ills which flesh is heir to, seems lo b&lt;
 daily gaining ground in public conli
 dencc. It was at first thought to bt
 more fanciful than sound, hut it liai
 wrought io much good that its reputatioi
 is well established.
 There arc r.ow in Northampton, threi
 establishments where the Hydropathh
 treatment is pursued, hut it is to tha
 under the care of Doctor Kuggles a
 Bcnsonville, that these remarks an
 confined, because this practitioner wai
 (it is believed the originator of a the
 ory connected with hydropathic treat
 rurul that at first subjected him to somi
 degree of ridicule, but which has sinc&lt;
 been advocated by medical men o
 i eminence both in this country and Eu
 rope. Dr Ruggles does not profess tc
 ho any other tiiaa a hydropathic prac
 t itioncr, arid he uses no agent hut water:
 he makes no claim to be an educatec
 physician, and it does not appear to be
 conceding him too much, to imagine
 that having confined his attention to the
 application of water, as a remedia
 agent, lie may have at least attained
 etjual skill with those who have yielded
 to the pressure of public opinion or oth
 er impulses, and cotnbiucd it with thcii
 former system of practice. Dr Ruggles
 is so nearly blind as to depend entirely,
 in his primary examination of those who
 seek his aid, on the sense of touch, and
 it is hy that delicate preception of what
 he terms the electrical state of the shin,
 that he forms his opinion whether the
 applicant would be benefited by* a
 course of hydropathic treatment. In
 the exercise of this mode of enquiry,
 Dr Ruggles is most candid, and in the
 cases of some who were very anxious to
 put themselves under his care, he has
 frankly told them that his treatment was
 not calculated to do them good. Dr
 Ruggles has maintained his theory for
 upwards of four years, and has during
 that time made it the successful basis oi
 his treatment of a great number of in
 dividuals. His establishment is capa
 ble of accomodating between thirty and
 forty patients, and is at present full; in
 deed, he has been obliged for many
 weeks past,almost daily to to turn away
 applicants.
 The establishment is very pleasantly
 situated, and comprises all requisite
 appliances for the most thorough course
 of hydrophatic treatment. At about a
 mile from the house is a copious stream
 of pure water, which falls from a con
 siderable height, and by the aid ol a
 needful apparatus forms a Douche bath.
 This is an important feature in the ad
 vantages of this establisnmcnt, for it is
 a privilege not always enjoyed in hydro
 pathic institutions.
 The medical gentlemen above alluded
 to as having discovered the presence of
 positive electricity in the skin, within the
 past year, are Dr Means of the Medical
 College of Georgia, and Dr llemmer
 of England. To the credit of the for
 mer, it may be mentioned that in his
 address before the College at the open
 ing of its annual session in August,
 Nov. Bth, HIT, lie takes honorable no
 tice of Dr Kuggles’remarkable and suc
 cessful practice.
 There is a passage in an article in the
 British and Foreign Medical Review, by
 Doctor John Forbes, Fellow of the
 Royal and Geological .Societies, that
 hears so immediately on this subject,
 it may lie as well to insert it, particular
 ly as it contains an admission that med
 ical practitioners have not hitherto ad
 dressed themselves as much as they
 might to the deranged state of the skin
 as a prolific source of disease, with a
 view to remedial treatment.
 The skin is a part through which
 nature has arranged that a large amount
 of matter should be removed from the
 body during health, and a still larger
 amount, of different u character, in the
 process of recovery from many diseases.
 It is well known that a deficient cuta
 neous excretion is incompatible with
 perfect health. Perhaps there is scarce
 ly am/ disease in ichieh the function of the
 shin is not to some extent, deranged. 7b
 ic'iat extent physicians hare not bcsto'.ccd
 sufficient pains to learn; —nor have they
 been accustomed to give much attention
 to thi&gt; part in the practical investigation
 of diseases. Still less has it acquired
 an important position in the list ot parts
 to which medical treatment is directed.
 Therefore, ice possess little information,
 in medical writers, us to the amount or
 frequency of cutaneous disturbance in
 general disease, as to the effect of thera
 peutic means in correcting such disturb
 ance, or as to the value of the correction
 in the cure of disease.

 An effective and innocuous incans of
 increasing the excretion from the skin
 being thus found 1 w hich appears to com
 dinc with its own peculiar action the
 indirect effect of a tonic, have w e not
 reason to regard it as a promising in
 strument of cure, in many disordered
 states of the system? We fully believe
 that we have. We know the utility of
 augmenting the secretion of the mucous
 membranes, the liver, the kidneys: we
 recognize this in our constant practice.
 It is by tins means that we combat a
 large proportion of chronic as well as
 acute maladies. should the shin
 alone be neglected l Physiology teaches
 us that it is the vehicle for conveying
 out of the system a large amount of
 matter, as well solid as liquid; and
 practical experience exhibits it as the
 channel through which the maftries inor
 hi in many instances, and the burthen
 of plethora generally, find their evil.
 These facts indicate it as a legitimate
 locality tor the same artificial measures
 which are found serviceable on other
 secreting organs.
 It is a remarkable circumstance that
 the privation of &gt;!ght should in Dr. Rug
 gles’s case ban* led t&lt;&gt; a more concern
 lrated attention to the other faculties,
 and thus made the sense ol touch the
 vehicle by winch be acquired his val
 uable secret. Cow per sa)«:

 And truly it is so. But why should
 there be any iodisposition to -allow Dr
 Kuggles the met it of his discovery
 The color of his skin cannot operate
 to his prejudice with the intelligent in
 habitants of New England, while i
i physician of the slave holding State of
 Georgia has volunteered him tbe meed
 of praisa.
 Those who are disposed to treat Dr
 Rugglos contemptuously, or even un
 courteously, should remember that all
 I science is progressive, though perhaps
 no department of it may owe any portion
 of its progress to them. But the pio
 nerrs in scientific research inay con
 sole themselves with the reflection that
 some of the most important discoveries
 did not procure their authors immediate
 fame, though their ultimate reward was
 immortality. There was a time when
 the circulation of the blood w as not
 known. Ifarrcy discovered it; he was
 ridiculed at the first promulgation of
 his theory, but nobody laughs at him
 now’. There was a period,—not very
 remote—when the law of gravitatiou
 was not understood, but no man is suf
 ficiently prodigal of his reputation as
 now’ to laugh at Sir Isaac Newton.
 There was an era, still nearer our
 own time, when the power of steam
 was not known, but every one is now
 ambitious to join the chorus in the praise
 of Fulton. ‘Tis true that all these men
 j had a skin somewhat paler than that of
 the discoverer of cutaneous electricity,
 but let it ho remembered that it was
 i out of chaotic darkness God first cre
 uled light* It is a prominent feature in
 i the divine economy that the greatest
 I effects are poduced from what appear
 to be the smallest causes. It is one
 of the processes by which the Almighty'
 wisdom has determined to check the
 arrogance of mao.
 PERSECUTION FOR NEW IDEAS.
 Harvey, who first discovered the cir
 culation ofthe blood, was styled, “vaga
 bond or quack,” and persecuted through
 life.
 Ambrose Parc, in the time of Fran
 cis 1., introduced the ligature as a sub
 stitute for the painful mode of stanching
 the blood after the amputation of a limb
 —namely, by applying boiling pitch to
 the surface of the stump. lie was, in
 consequence, persecuted with the most
 remorseless rancor by the Faculty of
 Physic, who ridiculed the idea of put
 ting the life of a man upon a thread,
 when boiling pitch had stood the test for
 centuries.
 Paracelsus introduced antimony as a
 valuable medicine; he was persecuted
 for the innovation, and the French par
 liament passed an act, making it penal
 to prescribe it; whereas it is now one
 ofthe most important medicines in dai
 ly use.
 The Jesuits of Peru introduced into
 Protestant England the Peruvian bark,
 (invaluable medicine,) but, being a
 remedy used by the Jesuits, the Protes
 tant English at once rejected the drug
 as the invention ofthe devil.
 In 171)3, Dr. Greenuelt discovered
 the curative power of canthurides in
 dropsy. As soon as his cures began to
 be noised abroad he was committed to
 Newgate by warrant of the President
 ofthe College of Physicians for pre
 scribing eauthai ides internally.
 Lady Montague first introduced into
 England small pox inoculation, having
 seen its success in Turkey in greatly
 mitigating that terrible disease. The
 faculty all rose in arms against its in
 troduction, foretelling the most disas
 trous consequences; yet it was in a
 few years generally adopted- by the
 most eminent members of the profes
 sion.
 Jenner, who introduced the still
 greater discovery of vaccination, was
 treated with ridicule and contempt, per
 secuted and oppressed by the Royal
 College of Physicians; yet he subse
 quently received large pecuniary grants
 from government for the benefit he had
 conferred on his country, by making
 known his valuable discovery; and at
 the present tiino its observance is very
 properly enjoined by the whole medical
 profession and the legislature.
 RIVER LIFE AT CANTON.
 Boats, used for the rearing of ducks
 and fowls, in which the proprietors,
 with their whole families, kith, kin, and
 generation, reside, line the hanks.—
 Very curious is the mode of treating
 these ducks. In the morning they are
 turned out upon the banks to seek their
 food; and in the evening the owner,
 standing whip in hand, calls them, with
 a peculiar cry, to their floating home.
 The whip, experience tells them, will
 be used without remorse upon the last
 straggler* The quacking, waddling,
 and scrambling crew obey, tumbling
 rapidly for w ard, in their laudable anxie
 ty to avoid the lash. No scene in na
 ture can be more amusing.
 These boats are from thirty to forty
 feet in length, and fitted up as domestic
 habitations. Over the deck is the
 usual roof, made of bamboo, and thatch
 ed with paddy (rice) straw, under which
 the rowers sit upon stools, eight inch s
 in height. The wife generally stands
 at the stern, moving a very long oar,
 which works u|»on an iron pivot, and
 both steers and propels the boat with a
 singular motion of her body aud wrists,
 in one corner is their household Joss,
 or deity, with joss sticks perpetually
 burning before him. Inscriptions on
 various-colored papers, together with
 tinsel decorations, hang about the do
 mestic shrine. Joss, always portly,
 looks peculiarly contented and happy
 in his arabesque abode. Night and
 morning they “chin chin” Joss, as they
 call it, honoring him by beating gongs,
 and burning paper-offerings.
 The wife, as she guides the boat, has
 frequently an infant fastened to her
 back, attached by a piece of cotton,
 while children of various ages play
 about the boat. The younger have
 guards attached to their backs as life
 buoys, lest they siioukl tall overboard.
 Although such a precaution is t us ta
 ken for the safety of their children,
 yet the Chinese would not assist one
 another in rescuing them from a watery
 grave, owing to the sujierstitious feed
 ing they entertain, in common with
 Scandinavian tribes, that a person res
 cued lrom drowning will inevitably in
 jure his preserver.
 To return to the boat; near its stem
 they invariably place their tea and culi
 nary uteuad*. A vegetable garden is fre
 quently suspended over the side. The
 frame is composed of bamboos, covered
 with a layer of earth. The centre of
 the boat is provided with a small tank,
 in whiAh they keep and fatten their
 fish, la a mat bag they keep th#tr
store* of rice. At night the/ sleep un
 der their thitched roof upon mats, with
 ratten, wooden, or earthen pillows.
 DISPLAY OP COURAGE BY A LIT
 TLE GIRL.
 As two gentlemen were erasing
 the suspension bridge below the FoMs
 from the Ameriean side, on Frida/ eve
 ning, when about two hundred /arda
 from the Canada side, the/ heard a
 noise like the falling of a hear/ bod/
 over the precipice, a few rods above the
 bridge, and immediately observed a lit
 tle girl running toward* the bridge.—
 She passed several men who were stand
 ing in the vicinity, and hastened to the
 lower side of the bridge, where she de
 sccnded a ladder or stairway made by
 pins being driven into a large pole 01
 log placed in an upright position,. and
 reaching from the lower side of the
 bridge some 80 or 90 feet down the
 precipice, to a short recess in the cliffs
 When she arrived at the bottom o
 the latter, she climcd with incrcasec
 speed along the side of the hill, undei
 the overhanging rocks, to the place fi on
 above which she had started, and de
 scending a few steps, she was observe*
 trying to raise and carry some object
 which the gentlemen who had watchc*
 her movements with increasing interest
 soon became satisfied was a child tha
 had fallen over the precipice. The]
 hastened to the end of the bridge, am
 sent dow n some men who had not knowi
 of the accident. The child, a little gir
 seven or eight years of age, was lashe*
 to the back of one of the men am
 brought up, alive, although greatly in
 jured, having one or both of its legs
 broken, and one eye considerably bruis
 ed, but it will probably recover. Tha
 the child was not instantly killed, is tru
 ly astonishing, as it must have faller
 over 109 feet perpendicularly, without
 anything to impede its progress, on the
 broken stones below.
 The coolness and intrepidity of the
 little girl, perhaps ten or eleven years
 of age, sister of the one who met with
 the accident, was also astonishing.—

 Rationale of Climate. —Howevct
 great may be the fluctuations of tem
 perature in the same months and sea
 sons—however sultry the summer or
 cold,the winter, in any particular year,
 its mean temperature varies but little
 from the climate or average actual
 mean of the locality, when once cor
 rectly ascertained; and, even the
 greatest variation between one year,
 and any other the most opposite in
 character, and extending over a long
 period of time, when accurately ex
 pressed in figures, appears so trivial
 that except to the meteorologist it fails to
 convey any adequate idea of the excess
 or deficiency of heat, or of the absolute
 difference in temperature between the
 periods in question.— Jameson's Jour.
 Spontaneous Combustion.—Spon
 taneous combustion arises frequently
 from cotton that has been saturated
 with oil. A case of this kind occurred
 at Boston on Thursday morning last, in
 the spontaneous combustion of some
 bales of cotton waste deposited in the
 Worcester Railroad Depot. The fire
 was extinguished with slight damage.
 Peripatetic Philosophy In
 walking the streets, the man who thinks
 of the future looks upward—the man
 who thinks of the past, downward.—lf
 he looks straight before him, he is oc
 cupied with the present; if he looks
 right arid left, he thinks, poor man, of
 nothing. If he cast frequent looks be
 hind him, lay it down as an infallible
 axiom, that lie is thinking then of his
 creditors. The man who walks leisure
 ly, is reflecting, meditating, calculating.
 The man who projects, moves rapidly;
 while he who runs is full of some an
 ticipated success in money, ambition
 or love.
 Macklin and Johnson, disputing on a
 literary subject, Johnson quotod
 Greek. “I dont understand Greek,”
 said Macklin. ‘‘A man who argues,
 should understand every language,”re
 plied Johnson. “Y'ery well,” said
 Macklin, and gave him a quotation from
 the Irish!
 It is the characteristic of u wise man
 to act on determined principles; and of
 a good man to be assured they are con
 formable to rectitude and virtue.
 Thoughts Abolt Thinking. —Few
 things are rarer than thinking. Many
 think they think,” sa/s Leigh Hunt,
 but, as the paradox implies, they are
 mistaken. Nine-tenths of what they
 call thought is only a vivid, involuntary
 revival of what they have read or
 seen.
 Fine Amusement. Baron Rothschild
 once said, Sometimes to amuse myself,
 1 give a beggar a guinea. He thinks
 it is a mistake, and, for fear 1 should
 find it out off lie runs as hard as he can.
 1 advise you to give a beggar a guinea
 sometimes—it is very amusing.
 Perseverance. —The greater the
 difficulty, the in ire glory is there in
 surmounting it. Skillful pilots gain
 their reputation from storms and tem
 pests.
 Devtii by WhisxEY.—At Indianapo
 lis, lad., the other day, one lad banter
 ed another to drink all the liquor he
 could buy. He was taken up at this
 offer a hiskey ami brandy were
 brought out, and the dainking com
 menced. Dose* after d »se were taken,
 until the drinking youth had swallowed
 about a quart He then become insen
 sible, aud lingered about thirty-six
 hoars, and died
 “I Jvc and let live/* is a true motto.
 People who desire to live themselves, do
 not always recognize the fact that they
 would live better, if they were williug
 that other folks should live too.
 An auctioneer from the Emerald Isle,
 while selling a stock of jewelry, in Great
 George-street recently, and descibing
 a pair of jet ear-rings to a very respect
 able company of ladies, exclaimed very
 earnestly,"lndeed ifmy wife was a wid
 ow, I would positivtdy buy them for
 her.**
 IC/Jt is a fact that the members
 of the House of Representatives ot the
 F. S. in 1819, refused Robert Fulton the
 use of their Hall to deliver a lecture on
 steam navigation, upon the ground that
 it was a visionary scheme.

 i A tlie philosophical derlurtion# of (lie learned Dr,
 i Means, of Emorv Colk-ge, Ga., ami thel wientifia
 ex;serintents of Mr. llemmer of England,* have
 recently and indubitably established the fart, that
 the cortelusions at which the undersigned arrived by
 tbe sense of touch, in 1844, are in harmony with
 natural ami physiological lans-—to wit, that tk«
 human lxx!y, in a healthy condition, is in a posit&gt;*»
 j rhitncol ilu/r, and that the t ketrical emanations
 from the ruth afar stii face, indicate health, or tha
 symptoms aad rharacter of disease—there i# some
 reason to hope, that certain physicians, igmmmt of
 I these principle# or nafnral laws, a knowkvlge of
 1 which is essential to tlie sate nml intelligent prnctico
 of the healing art, will reuse tlieir vucileintionn
 against the positive ei-kctricai. state ofih#
 human Lmlj-, and will be#itate to dissuade these
 w horn th&lt; y have faik'd to relieve of tlieir complaint*,
 from seeking nature’s remedy at the Nokthawp
 toh Wate* Cork. Thus sustained by the light
 of science, the undersigned may I* permitted hero
 to re|x at his experience, that, in all rases where tlie
 wrist, stomach, or lungs, are in tlie eleetro-iH-gativo
 condition, tin* patient is lx*yoml the power of water
 to afford relief. On the other hand, when the part#
 of the Ixidy alluded to, are in tlx: r k*rtro-p»#itivo
 state, however disarranged, there is growud to hopa
 for a cure.
 Had not the results of past years’ pratfir*
 already convinced the pul lie ot the safety or trulh**
 fulness ol the piineiples by which the undersigned i#
 governed, in detecting the symptoms and chareetev
 i ol disease, and practising the cure, the recent scien
 tific demonstration ol tlieir correctness, l«y Profossor
 Means and Mr. Ileininer, could not tail toconvimo
 the most inereduhrtis.
 j Gratefully appreciating tlie credit so generously
 awarded for his siueess as a Hydropathic Piacti
 linner, by a discerning public, and the gnititud#
 evinced liy those whom he has had the pkasnre to
