"liere, must carry absurdity upon the TCTy fac*
 of it.
 If the charge were just, whichjwe deny
 it would no* be subject properly calling fo
 denunciation, but for lamentation, and conae
 a different mode of treatment alto
 pother Who can conceive of a more de
 plorable spectacle than that of a downtroddci
 people, warmly embracing the iron heel tha
 proudly stand* upon their necks What bu
 the dullest obtuseness imaginable, with a lota
 absence of all the high and noble aspiration
 of the human mind, could render a «peciacl&lt;
 like this even possible? What truly wi*
 and generous heart would attempt to remedy
 a case like this by applying the lash of Ac
 nunciation? Would he not rather, under th«
 promptings of his benevolent heart, remove
 with s dexterous hand the scales from then
 benighted minds and after the utterance oi
 his lips was no longer choked at the doleful
 Sight, would lie not speak to them in the ten
 direst accents of sympathy and ]ove t Thii
 tn *dc of treatment, we conceive, would Ik
 both generous and philosophical, every way
 adapted to meet such a case. Hut we deny
 t ie charge preferred, and of course the neces
 sity of the peculisr treatment. That there
 are evils existing among the nominally free,
 there is no question; but if hostility to the
 anti-slavery movement be one of those evils,
 we are very much deceived. In sustaining a
 charge of this kind, it must be shown that our
 people are more grossly stupid than any
 among their ranks, we think, arc prepared to
 admit. All the attempts, within our knowl
 edge, that have hitherto been made to fix this
 stigma upon them, appear to our mind to be
 founded in erroneous views, which cannot
 possibly result in any good whatever to our
 people, but may be productive of some mis
 chief. We have iio design to impugn any
 vine’s motives who may differ from us on this
 point. We charge none with evU intentions
 tn their endeavors to sustain this charge.
 We have heard several who take the affirma
 tive side of this question, both in public and
 private, disclaim all evil intentions, and we are
 hound in honor to believe them, until other
 wise convinced. Hut in every instance, we
 could not help recollecting the man who is
 represented in scriptures as scattering fire
 brands, arrows and death, and then saying.
 Am I not in sport? We repeat, that we do
 not impugn the motives of any, but it does
 appear to us that the charge of “hostility” is
 founded altogether on erroneous views, having
 a tendency to evil results. This we shall, if
 n ‘cessary, endeavor to show in our next. We
 shall at that time, however, attempt the ex
 posure of those erroneous views, particularly
 in their reference to that branch of the church
 to which we have the honor to belong. In
 bringing this article to a clo3C, the under
 signed takes the liberty of informing a certain
 frie id, without naming him, that nothwith
 sUmling it may bu true that he has never yet
 made himself wry useful;” he is neverthc-j
 less nowise ambitious to signalize himself in

 FutEsa Douglass:— Nine years ago, 1
 saw Frederick Douglass, the boy that w rote
 his own pass to enable himself to escape the
 blessings of the divine institution o( the South.
 I sympathized with thu runaway, as he told
 his unvarnished tale. I admired the orator
 as he appealed to his audience, by all the
 powers of eloquence, in behalf of his down
 trodden race. In fine, 1 loved the colored
 man as he stood before us, displaying his
 manly intellect, unfolding truth in her native j
 simplicity to an attentive multitude, and plead
 ing for that mercy to lie given to his enslaved
 brethren, which none but the determined foes
 of God and man could or date refuse. Since
 that time, I have watched the onward and up
 ward march of the fugitive, as the star of hope
 to those of his race doomed to unrequited toil
 and suffering.
 When the shoe, by his own efforts and the
 assistance of kind triends ai home and abroad,
 bad become the editor, I greeted with un
 feigned joy the first number of the Noith
 Star, as it rose with morning brightness
 above the North-eastern horizon.
 I receive your paper, and admire the spirit
 in which it is conducted, as also the skill and
 literary abilities of its editor at such a distin
 guished post. God knows my earnest desire
 that you may continue to stand forth as an
 ornament to your friends, a noble representa
 ative of the coloreJ race—not of Africa, but
 of America, and a mighty instrument in the
 hands of God for reforming the world, and
 especially for hastening the overthrow of ty
 ranny, and ushering in the happy day of lib
 erty to the captive, and equal rights to the
 poor and oppressed sons and daughters of the
 United Slates.
 Yet with all my liking, I have somewhat
 against your paper. I understand it to advo
 cate the Anti-Sabbath doctrine —that there is
 uo difference in the days of the week, and
 that the view that tha first day of the week
 should !&gt;e kept holy unto the Lord,” is an
 old and exploded dogma.
 If this be your it is certainly most 1
 decidedly anti-scriptural. I hope I am ad-J
 dressing one who receives the Uible as tli«
 word of God. I may therefore show the au-!
 thority of the scripture for the Sabbath. In
 Exodus xx., 8, we have the express com
 rnand, Remember the Sabbath day to keep
 it holy.” Isa. lxi., 2. “Blessed is the man j
 that doeth tins, and the son of man that lay-
 eth hold on u; that keep the Sabbath from
 polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing
 any evil.” \N heti a blessing is promised to*
 the doer of anything, a curse follows him
 that refuses to olrey. \ou may perhaps say
 that this was m Old Testament days. Be it
 no. Show roe when these laws were repeal
 ed. I’hrist came not to destroy the laws, but
 to fulfil.
 In Luki, iv., 16—“ And he came to Naza
 reth, where he had been brought up, and, as
 tus custom was, he went into the Synag&lt;»guc
 on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.” 1
 forbear to quote further from sacred writ. It
 ii becoming too common now to consider
 the Bible of no more authority than any pro
 fane historical rocord. 1 hope that i redertek
 Douglass may not so look on the holy scrip
 tures. 1 have spoken plainly because I am
 your friend. I dislike to hear the Sabbath
 lightly spoken of. I would be much pleased
 to have your opinion plainly #xpres*ed“on that.
•abject; end I pray God he may direct you
 in presenting troth to your reader*.
 Go forward in your great work of reform.
 Bn still more encouraged to plead fur your
 oppressed countrymen. God time is com
 ing. The stare shill ere long go free snd
 the tvrant, unless ho speedily repent, shall
 know the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty
 God against him that oppresses the pOM and
 reproaches his Maker. If you see It to in
 sert this in the North Star, please give your
 views on the Sabbath question.
 Very truly yours, W. F. G.
 Remarks on the foregoino.— -Regarding
 the question as to the sacredness of one day
 above another, purely a theological question,
 having no necessary bearing whatever on the
 cause w hich the North Star was established
 to promote, we have never felt it our duty to
 express any opinion with respect to it in this
 paper. While wc hold no views on this sub
 ject but such as are, in out judgment, per
 fectly consistent with both the Old and the
 New Testament, 3nd such as are in unison
 w ith the obvious dictates of common Hense,
 we yet feel it would he misappropriating an
 important instrumentality, and abusing the
 high trust confided to us by our friends, were
 we to open such a discussion in the North j
 Star, as that to which a compliance with our
 friend’s request would inevitably lead. There
 arc more important topics that claim, and
 ought to claim, the attention of mankind just
 now, than the question mooted by our kind
 correspondent. We need moral rather than
 theological light.— f. d.
 Haitian Correspondence— No, V.
 Friends Douglass Delany: —ln iny
 last, I gave you some account of the fdcs
 which, with their gaiety, serve to diversify
 the current of Haitian existence. The sud-
 Jenness of the vessel’s departure, prevented j
 tie from speaking of them as fully as I could
 lave wished, and subsequent events have
 endered it unnecessary, since the splendor of
 ill those which I have seen has been sur
 passed, and their pomp more than equalled,
 iy the festivities of which Port-au-Prince has
 ately been the theatre. 1
 The 20tli of August witnessed the return
 &gt;f H is Excellency, Faustin Soulouque, Pre- j
 iident of the Republic of Haiti, to the espi
 al. This event, which had been for several
 veeks anticipated, was hailed with every
 nanifestation of public rejoicing. At the
 &gt;ortal of Leoganc, the Southern entrance into
 he city, a magnificent Triumphal Arch had
 teen erected, decorated with a portrait of the
 diicf who now controls the destinies of the
 of the Antilles, an l adorned with vari
 »us devices symbolical of measures, the
 idoption of which promises her a bright arid
 glorious future. Throughout the entire place,
 die galleries of all the houses were adorned
 with branches of the national tree of Haiti,
 he majestic palm-tree, which, in its very ap
 &gt;C3ranee, speaks that language of victory,
 riumph and rejoicing, which florists have
 isually accorded to it. At about 8 o’clock on
 he day above mentioned, the cortege entered
 he city. First came the soldiery, returning
 'rum the campaign, amounting to several
 housands, and, in their laureled aspect, re
 ninded one of the times when Jlirnam wood
 ipproachcd to Dunsinane.” Then came Ilis
 Excellency, attended by his stutF, the mem
 bers of the cabinet, and the general officers of
 die army. They were met at the gates by
 L he councils of the city, who, in a brief ad
 dress, presented the felicitations of the inhab
 itants to their gallant compatriots on the -suc
 cess which had attended their march. The
 immense procession then proceeded to the
 church, where a Te Dcum was sung, and
 thanksgiving offered to the God of Nations
 for the care which he had extended over the
 Haitian Republic. That evening, and the
 two following ones, the city fairly blazed forth
 its joy in view of the triumph of order, and
 the restoration of public tranquility. These
 illuminations, of which the very sight was
 pleasurable, were rendered still more pleasing
 by their suggestions. There they gleamed,
 the emblems of the dawning of a brighter and
 a better time.
 The President had gone forth on his expe
 dition to the South at a moment when the po
 litical horizon presented the aspect of a com
 ing storm, the darkest and most fearful that a
 nation can be called upon to encounter.
 Fierce clouds, freighted with the dread ele
 ments of civil war, hung lowering over this
 unhappy country, threatening to deluge its
 highlands and savannas with fraternal slaugh
 ter. His stay in the disaffected legion had
 the happy effect of tranquilizing the public
 mind and his return was heralded by the re
 establishment of national confidence, and glad
 promises of an era of prosperity. Heaven
 grant that they may not be futile, and that the
 blessed lime they predict may be of long con
 tinuance
 The illuminations which gladdened the
 streets of Port-au-Prince on the evenings o
 which I speak, have been renewed on another
 and yet more joyous occasion. The first of
 September, in this city, was, by turns, a day
 •f the profoundest grief, and of the loudest
 exultation. Four persons, who had been tried
 for political offences, and condemned to death,
 were carried out to Last’aobas, a place on
 the frontiers, to be shot. They were accom
 panied for some distance by a large number of
 persons, the greater portion of whom were
 women. The loud shrieks and violent de
 spair of the last mention, rendered the spec
 tacle a very melancholy one, while ihey con
 trasted strangely with the dignified hearing
 and submissive composure of the unfortunate
 prisoners. For some hours after their depar
 ture, a deep gloom brooded over the place,
 and sadness was depicted upon the counte
 nances of all. About two o'clock in the af
 ternoon, however, it was reported throughout
 the town that His Excellency had pardoned
 the condemned, sod had sent off menengers
 to command their return. The news spread
 like wildfire, and gave binh to a general re
 joicing, as loud in its manifestation as was the
 grief of the morning. Almost the entire
 population flocked to the Portal of St. Jo
 sephs, to congratulate the prisoners on their
 escapu from execution and as they followed
 them along the streets, caused the air to ring
 with shouts of Vive le President! Vive ie
 President Soulouque As before stated,
 the city was brilliantly illuminated and on
 the following morning, large number ot la
 dies proceeded to the Palace, to present tbetr
 respects to Hu Excellency, and return him
 thanks for having seen proper to render the
condemned the sebjerte of the Executive
 clemency. Since that time, quite a Urge
 number of political prisoners hare been lther
 a ted, and it is daily anticipated that more will
 shortly he released,
 I regret exceedingly that it was not per
 mitted me to spend the first of August this
 year in ray natire land. The unfortunate cir
 cumstances in which this country has lately
 been placed, prevented the Voice of philan
 thropy here from joining in the hallelujah
 which hailed the anniversary of the birthday
 of eight hundred thousand freemen—that glo
 rions event which set an example to the na
 tions, in the progress of human liberty. Pre
 vious to that time, oppressed humanity had
 regained its rights by deeds of blood and vio
 lence. Stem, indiscriminate war, or expa
 triation equally fearful, had ordinarily marked
 the restoration of the God-given gift of free
 dom. Through the fierce deluge of inflamed
 and unbridled passion, the ark, bearing the
 elements destined for the construction of an
 other and a brighter world, had been con
 demned to float. But the Emancipation of
 the British West Indies pointed out another i
 mode for the redemption of a people. It told
 that, henceforth, man was to resume his
 wrested rights through more pleasing means;
 and that Liberty, with strength gathered from
 former conflicts, was to march on, henceforth,
 with flaunting trophies and through triumphal
 arches—a bloodless and joyous conqueror.—
 The emancipation of Martinique and Guada
 loupe, of St. Thomas and Santa Crux, has
 declared that some of the nations of the earth
 have profitted by the lesson. It is a sad re
 flection, that the land of Washington is still
 associated with Cuba, Porto Rico and the
 Brazilian Empire, in eflbrts to annihilate the
 inborn dignity of man. In the hope that this
 may not long continue, and that before much
 time has elapsed, we may be called to join in
 a jubilee caused by the liberation of three
 millions of Americans, I subscribe myself,
 Truly youis, HAROLD.
 From our own Correspondent.
 London, Sept. 28, 1848.
 Since my last, there has been anothet
 outbreak in Ireland, in the neighborhood of
 Cariick-on-Suir. The reports were in the
 first instance very alarming; but there is
 every reason to believe that these were highly
 exaggerared. It was stated that four thousand
 men were encamped on the mountains, under
 Dohemy and O’Gounan—then the number
 fell to four hundred, which may be conjec
 tured as the more correct statement. This
 demonstration, however, evidences that the
 suppression of the “late rebellion” has done
 hut little towards the permanent restoration of
 order in that unhappy country. Doheny is
 noV reported to have made his escape to
 Paris. The state trials, at Clonmel, com
 menced to-day. Five bills have been found
 against O'Brien, Meagher and others. A
 Dublin paper says that the letters discovered
 in O'Brien’s portmanteau have disclosed the
 fact, that a number of the Popish ecclesiasti
 cal body are implicated in the late disturb
 ances.
 At home, nothing of importance has trans
 pired of late but the death of one of the poli
 tical leaders, Lord George Bcntinck, who ex
 pired quite suddenly on Thursday last, in the
 41st'year of his age. The Times, in
 speaking of this event, says The curtain
 has dropped on protection—its hero is no
 more Our Queen is still in Scotland,
 among her Highland subjects. She has lately
 charmed them by attending divine service in
 the parish kirk of Cratlive also, by being
 present at a “gathering” of the clans, and by
 ascending to the top of Lochnagair.
 Europe is still convulsed. France is again
 in a state of great excitement, partly owing
 to the recent election for three vacancies in
 the representation of Paris. There were 115
 competitors, including Emile de Girandin,
 Marshal Bugeaud, and other celebfated men.
 The result has found Prince Louis Napoleon
 at the head of the poll, where he has been
 placed by an overwhelming majority. He is
 retured by five different departments. The
 numbers are as follows
 Nopoleon, 110,752
 Fould,’ 78,891
 Rasp ail, 06,973
 Fould is a Banket and a Conservative;
 Raspail a Communist and a Destructive and
 the return of a trio, differing so widely, evi
 dences the drastic state of public opinion in
 France.” The French papers arc filled with
 allusions to Napoleon's election, which some
 of them term the most important event since
 the revolution of February,” as the election
 of the Deputy is but the precursor of the
 choice of the President. Cavaignac’s popu
 larity seems still on the decline and the elec
 tion of Prince Louis Napoleon will probably
 occasion him and his colleagues considerable
 difficulty in the preservation of peace and
 order. One party propose to elect Cavaignac
 at once to the Presidency, without waiting for
 the final vote of the Constitution and the
 Legitimist party, it is said, determined bring
 forward General Lamoriciere as their candi
 date, in preference to Cavaignac.
 Messina has been taken by the Neapolitan
 troops, after a bombardment. No authentic
 details have vet been received, Ihe armis
 tice between Charles ‘Albert and Austua has
 been prolonged.
 The recent news from Frankfort has been
 very exciting. Riots have taken place there,
 barricades have been raised, and the blood-red
 flag has been hoisted. The ostensible cause
 of all this, is the late Parliamentary resolution
 on the Danish armistice. A faction, deputxl
 in tl»* Assembly, urged ou a mob to attack
 1 the hall of council. Inflammatory speeches
 were made, and imprecations hurled not only
 against the armistice, but against the Parlia
 ment itself. Great excitement followed.—
 Troops were summoned into the city; the
 populace began to atone them, and to raise
 barricades, The ministry wete fully prepared
 for the intended attack; which took place
 when the military attempted to remove the
 barricades. The rioters re fused lo yield. A
 slurp three hours’ eon tea* took place. Ihe
 'soldiers acted with firmoem, bravery and for
 bearance, and soon every point was in their
 hands, and the rioters were defeated. One
 grievous iocideui baaoccuired. Prince Lioh
 iaowski and Major Vob Aoerewald were
 murdered while out of the city to meet
 the troops about to eoter. Too much pnuse
 cannot bo gtvcu to the Arch Duke and hit
 government, for the promptitude and energy
 with which they acted out the emie. The
 Regent has stoce fasned a proclamation, in
which be pledges bims.’lf to maintain the hb- j
 ertj of the German peopb*. sad in which be
 reminds them that they «"di toon be de
 prived of their true indcp- ndence, if hw
 lessoc— and anarchy were to grt the upper
 hand in Germany.” The last accounts from
 Frankfort state that order, to a great extent,]
 is restored in that city, though troops mill a-
 copy the streets. S. P. Q. H.

 Passion for Tobacco. —Those who u e
 tobacco know the strength of the habit. It
 is as hard to break from it as it is to abandon
 the use of intoxicating drinks—some say
 •ten more difficult. The distinguished preach
 er, Birchard, thus relates his own experi
 ence in hb anti-tobacco war
 1 was once, said he an inTerataie lover ol
 tobacco, and l know how difficult it is to
 break the habit of nsing it; still it can be
 done. 1 indulged in the use of the weed to
 a great exccess; I loved it; but knowing that
 its effects were bad, and especially ill-become
 a man of the gospel, I made one almighty
 resolve *o quit it. With that resolution I
 tood a tremendous ‘cud,’ which was to be my
 wind off. I chewed it and chewed it, and
 ‘rolled it as a sweet norsel under my tongue,’
 and from one cheek to the other, for three
 weeks. It is certain tobacco never tasted so
 good before; and I shed tears when I recol
 lected that it was to be my last indulgence.
 When its strength was all gone, I threw it
 away: ‘There, Burehard,’ said I, ‘there
 goes your last—yotr omega of quids!’ Well,
 for a while it was very hard doing without it,
 and I was often sorely tempted to try it again.
 Old tobacco chewers would pull out their
 rusty steelboxes, give them a scientific snap,
 and say, ‘Burehard, have a chew!’ and for a
 long time, whenever I heard the elick of [a
 tobacco box, I involuntarily put my hand in
 my trowsers to get hold of my pig-tail. In
 fact I am afiaid 1 sometimes blundered dread
 fully in my sermans, my thoughts being more
 rrhaps on tobacco then upon the Lord. But
 stuck to my resolution; and neither ‘cav
 endish’ noi pig-tail’ hts ever been between
 my teeth from that day to this!
 In my youth,” says Horace Wapole, I
 thought of writing a satire upon mankind
 but now. in my old age,l think I should write
 an apology for them.”

 that Letters Patent have lieea taken out by tii" Sub
 scrilier for his reee it great improvements in the con
 struction and manufacture of Ft ki.iiCvi.tiv xtohs
 an improvement so great as to entirely revolutionize
 the w hole system of farming, by reducing tbe ex|nMise
 one-half or more. Wherever they have lietui intro
 duced, they have met the deride I approbation ol

 CERTIFICATES.
 This may certify tint we, the Snlisn iliers, have
 seen ail I ns" I the Patent Wliecl Cultivator,invented
 bv Nathan Idr, of Shelby, Oilcans Co., New
 Y v ork, an I believe it to lie, as a labor-saving ma
 eliiue, one of the greatest improvements of tire age.
 By it, a farmer can put in from ten to fifteen acres
 more of wheat i.i a year, with the same amount of
 team lalsir; lie ran also sow it ia much better order.
 By it also Canada thistles and other noxious weeds
 may lie totally extirpated. S.ii I machine is so con
 structed that it can he regulated to go any depth. In
 means of screws on the upper part of the machine,
 and thus either plow up the ground th-imnghly, or
 only just brush the surface. Upon tie- whole, ive
 think it decidedly the In st m ieliin ever invented tbr
 pulverising the ground mid facilitating tlie labor ol
 t the Farmer, and as such W 3 clieci lally recoium"ii I ii
 to our brother Cirmers.

 made purchase of anoth.-r. We can with this PI &gt;vx
 jmrpare with two horse*, eight acres of la.id |s-r day

 will yield 5 bush, ixt acre more.
