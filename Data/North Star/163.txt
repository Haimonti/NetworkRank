Philadelphia, Sept. 22. 1818.
 At a large and spirited Anti-Slavery
 meeting, hell in the Brick Wesley Church,
 in the city of Philadelphia, Sept. 21st, l 4
 Si mi el Y an Braeklc *u called to the Chair,
 and J. M. Buatdl appointed Secretary. Pray* i
 was off-nred by Her. Mr. Galbrath.
 The Chairman th»n introduced tothemiot
 ing Mrs. Lacretia Mott, who, m a speech ol
 surpassing beauty, enchained the audience in
 breathless attention—took a brief view of the
 evils of slavery—their influence upon the col
 ored people of the North—the commencement
 and progress of the Anti-Slareiy enterprise
 —the Philadelphia riots, the burning ol Penn
 sylvania Hall, and the terrible suffering* ol
 tho people of color in this place. She re
 gretted that in this hour ol trial the love ol
 many had waxed cold ,and w ere now found on
 the side of the oppressor. I he sj&gt;eak« r con
 cluded with an urgent appal to professing
 Christians to come up nobly to the wors, pre
 pared for sacrifices, and pledged anew to the
 cause of Freedom and of the suffering poor.
 Charles Lenox Rcmond, the faithful, tried,
 and eloquent champion of human liberty, next
 occupied the platform. He observer! that
 much had been said about the infidelity of
 abolitionists. He called attention to the De
 claration of Sentiments put forth by the Ame
 rican Anti-Slavery Society, and challenged
 any one to point out any passage savoring ol
 infidelity in that instrument. He wished that
 this document could be found in the hands ol
 every church member in the community. lit
 was convinced that few of them had read it,
 and therefore they occupied an unintelligent
 position upon this question, lie then pro
 ceeded to show, in a masterly manner, that
 prejudice amongst colored people on account
 of complexion, strengthens the hands ol the
 oppressor—gives the lie to our Anti-Slavery
 professions, and rivets more firmly the chains
 of the American bondman. lhc speaker
 next piocecded to comment in strong lan
 guage upon the following notice in the Phila
 delphia Ledger of Sept. 20th
 No rn k. —The colored portion of the com
 munity, will have an opportunity afforded
 them of visiting the exhibition of the Last
 supper, The Trial and Crucifixion of the
 Saviour, in the Assembly Buildings, on
 Friday the 22d, and Tuesday the 20th inst—
 those (lavs and evenings being set apart foi
 them in consequence of numerous request;
 being daily received by the proprietor.”
 Had the proprietor of this exhibition beer
 present, his ears would have been made t&lt;
 tingle, and his hair to stand on end like
 quills upon the fretful porcupine,” by tin
 burning rebuke upon his conduct, as it fel
 from the lips of this distinguished orator.
 Cyrus M. Burleigh followed in a master!)
 expose of the inconsistency of those who
 coinplain of the cruelty of prejudice, and yei
 would sanction it, by attending the exhibition
 on the days specified in the notice, and of the
 wickedness of the religion that would deny
 our Saviour, were lie to appear in this Chris
 tian community in the olive hue of the inhab
 itants of the Fast, the privilege of going with
 while Christians to witness the exhibition of
 his own Crucifixion.
 It was on motion,
 U-solvcd, That a Committee be appointed
 to draft resoiulions expressive of the sense of
 this un cling in relation to the Notice” in

 London, Sept. 21, 1848.
 The last accounts represent Paris as pro
 foundly tranquil. The report of the Commit
 tec appointed by the National Assembly t
 investigate the causes of the recent rebellion
 of May and June, and, if possible, to dis
 criminate their authors, has, you are aware
 been presented. A prolonged and storm;
 debate ensued. The very reading of the doc
 uincni was repeatedly interrupted by mem
 bors, impatient to rush to the tribune to idea
 themselves of the allegations against them
 as soon as they were named—the Ass mbl;
 swayed hither and timber, a sea of turhulen
 excitement. Gravely and earnestly the Presi
 dent entreated order, which hardly obtained
 the n porl was at length concluded, and the
 red republicans (or those supposed to be such
 were lice to clear themselves as best the;
 could. Lcdiu Kullm has escaped, but Loui;

 he says is manly—apparently honest —evi
 dently to the purpose.
 Ills Majesty harlos Albert, King of Sar
 dinia, 1 icdiuoiit and Savoy, has at lengtli
 found out that, whatever other qualification!
 he possesses, he has not those which go L:
 constitute a great general. 'The result of tin
 campaign is certainly trae able to his eggre
 gious blunders. The Austrian Marshal,
 Bradetski, has more than regained his laurels
 as a military commander. IBs sovereign |,aa
 lavished honors on tin 1 subject v\ ho has re
 conquered lus fairest kingdom; and the Led
 of the icy North, the haughty Czar, has been
 moved to express, in the warmest terms, f tia
 imperial approbation of the Marshal’s prow
 ess, as also of the loyalty which led him m

 c reign. M eanwbil the i-ix week**' anni.au c

 and sends earnest invitations to divers French
 generalu to undertake its command. Bedeauj

 mderation. Rumors are now afloat that a|
 Polish fjt ■neral of high repute meanwhile ac-’
 crpts. The mediation of France and Eng
 land continues; yet professedly hoping for;
 peace, each side prepares for war.
 The ScbUswig Holstein affair appears
 lik»dv t&lt;» he a bone of contention for many a
 month to corn*. Prussia, the great military
 power of Germany, and the instigator of the,
 movement, has granted the Danes an armis
 tice. The brave descendants of the old sea,
 kings have conceded as much as they deemed
 compatible with, their honor; the armistice
 was approved by the Frankfort Ministry, but
 the Assembly having negatived it, that Ministry J
 here resigned. One of the first acts of Uni-
 led Germany is, alas, to quarrel with one of
 the leading m -mVrs of its own family.
 Our Parliament was prorogue! on Thurs
 day, the jilt inat. There were present in our
 House of Lords, to listen to the melodious j
 accents of our Queen, the representatives of
 very different principles. At the foot of the
 throne stood the Prince de Joinville and the
 Due d’Aumalc, the descendants of a line of
 sovereigns as ancient and as illustrious as the
 ancestry of the graceful spoaker, now exiled
 from home and country. In the gallery sat
 Louis lllanc, the man of yesterday—to-day,
 no less an exile. The speech was as un
 meaning as royal speeches usually are. With
 us, the Queen is an institution.”
 Lord John Russell went to Ireland, to be
 hold with his own eyes the scenes, and hear
 with his own ears the tales of Irish misery.
 \o less has he hoard and seen—enough to
 sliww him that half this results from Irish im

 has been too short to produce any beneficial

 S. P. Q. R.
 Corresjwiuiencc of the Pittsburgh Gazette.
 A Preacher in Itonriuge a—Master
 Mason Sold, Arc.
 Louisville, Ky., Sept. 8, 1818.
 On the 7th inst., Peter Roberts, a free
 man of color, a regularly licensed Methodist
 preacher, a member of tiie Indiana African
 Conference, and a Master Mason of the Phi
 ladelphia Lodge, was sold at public auction
 before the Court House door, in this city,
 for the term of one year. He was bought by
 J. L. Hyatt, for $75,50.
 Roberts was arrested and carried before a
 Justice of the Peace, by James S. Speed, on
 a charge of having violated an act passed by
 the legislature of Kentucky, in 1848, which
 prohibits free Negroes from migrating to, and
 remaining in the State more than thirty days;
 and provides that any negro who is convicted
 of a violation thereof, shall give bond with
 security in the penalty of $5OO, conditioned
 that such negro shall leave the State within
 uirieiv days, and never more return and if
 he fail or refuse to give such bond, that he lie
 sold fur the term of one year, to the highest
 bidder.
 Roberts was convicted of a violation of
 this act, and was ordered to give the bond,
 which lie refused to do, and he was then or
 dered to be sold—w hereupon, the counsel for
 Roberts applied to (ffianoelloi Nicholas for a
 writ of prohibition, which was awarded,
 returnable to the Jefferson Circuit Court, ar
 resting the order of the sale.
 The case on the w rit of prohibition was
 argued before the lion. U. liullick, on the
 (Itli and 7tli instant, by Messes. Thurston and
 Speed for Roberts, and Messrs. Guthrie and
 Logan for the Justice of the Peace. Rotierts
 filed a declaration in prohibition, alleging in
 substance, that he was a citizen of Indiana;
 that he had resided there for a number of
 years and that lie was, at the time lie was
 I arrested, residing w ith his wife and children
 in Jeff rsonville, Indiana; that about the first
 of July, ISIS, he had rented a barber's shop
 in the city of Louisville, Kentucky that he
 carried on the business of a barber during the
 day, and crossed the river to his residence in
 the evening, and returned in the morning to
 his employment; that he was born of fret
 parents in the State of North Carolina, ant
 had emigrated from there to the State oi
 i Indiana a number of years ago that lie wuj
 arrested, under the act referred to, tried am;
 convicted, and would he sold, unless the Just
 ice was prohibited bv this Court—To whiel
 the Justice pleaded the arrest trial and eonvic
 tiou in bar, and the plaintiff demurred to th&lt;
 j plea.
 j The grounds of the demurrer, as arguec
 I by the counsel for the plaintiff were, that tin
 act under which the plaintiff was convicted
 was in violation of the Constitution of tin
 United States—See fourth Article, secom
 Section—which provides that the Citizen
 lof each State be entitled to all the privilege
 Sand immunities of citizens in the sevt-ra
 States.’—The case was very ably argued oi
 iiehalf of Roberts, by Messrs. Thurston am
 j Speed, and on behalf of the Justice by Guth
 rie and Logan, and occupied the Court tw.
 days.
 Judge Bullock decided, that the free ne
 proesjAcre not citizens of any State of th
 1 nion, in the sense the word citizen wa
 used in the Constitution of the United States
 His opinion was iicdi\ere&lt;l orally, and I ca
 only give you the substance of it. He he!
 t lie negro was only a sojourm r in the Unite
 States, and had no guaranties under the Con
 slit'.uion that be was not a party to the sc
 rial compact, either of the State Government
 or of the Government of the United States
 that any State might drive the free ncgroc
 from their midst; that they were aliens an
 strangers ill a strange land.
 The Judge was about two hours in dcliv
 eriug his opinion.
 Before bis opinion was delivered, 1 was c
 opinion that citizens,*’ as used in the Cur
 solution of the 1 nited States,covered all Has*
 es and conditions of men who were born ujm»
 our tree soil, ol free parents, and who wer
 not aliens. But it seems that the negro bor
 in the l nited States lias no country. If thi
 l»c true, we may do as the ancient Roman
 did, make slaves of those foreigners— as the
 arc here without protection.

 From Um&gt; Killnimj Modrmoe, Srjit. 4.
 Having romc to thii town to-day fir the per
 pr«e of ascertaining the troth or fidthuod of the
 various firing rumors at to the pn-dtinn, strength
 ami exploits &lt;*f the insurgent* y extents y emcanip
 ed r*n tlie Aheny Hill, which you hare already
 given to jottr readers, 1 nut proceed to inform
 you of the itiU'iuenti which may I*o depended
 upon a?' strictly true,am.l lh's*o which were exag
 gerated through the terror of the narrntor*.
 You were fully correct in statu** that the au
 thnrities in the neighborhood of Canids ha lap
 prehendcJ an outbreak, an lluid taken precau
 ti«m&lt;« to meet any sudden attack upon the town,
 during the la»t i’ll*! of l*at week, and it appear*
 that on Monday the insurgent# began to muster
 the lull&lt;&gt;f Aheny, or Kilclipitt, near the .SlaU
 tfiurriw, where tfu-y were drilled Ly their lead
 ers. an i supplied themselves with food hvlevy
 i-ig contribution* from the mirrouoding fanners,
 win* were compelled to send in several head of
 cattle. Wl*o th** leaders were remains unknown
 at present, audit is very doubtful whether the}
 were men of greater experience or information
 than the masses who compote the niaiu bodv
 of the rebels. 1 Iwlieve the first act of actual
 aggreasiou was made against ti.e constabulary
 party stats* *ncd at l’ortlaw, in the county of Wa
 terford.
 A detachment of the insurgents surrounded the
 baravk. an*i demanded a surrender of the police
 men's arms. The party within refused to comply
 and several shots* were then fired on both sides
 The police escaped altogelher uninjured, but the
 insurgents sustained a loss of two men killed up
 on the spot, ami some wounded, which caused
 them to retire in great confusion. At about 4 P.
 M. another detachment from the camp of Aheny
 preceded to the Slate quarry poiifo station,
 which they found deserted and then hunted, as
 you have already stated, the constabulary Lav
 ing previously retired uj*on I’iltown. At about
 seven in the evening a body of 100 men, armed
 with pikes and guns, proceeded to surround the
 police station of Gleubower. The various consta
 bulary parties in the district had during the day
 received orders to retreat to Garrick, aul convey
 tlieir property with them, as they were exposed
 to much danger whilst remaining in their insolat
 ed positions, and so near the rebel camp. The
 Gleubower men w ere in the act of placing tlieir
 effects upon cars, for the purpose of rutnovil,
 w hen they perceived the eueuiy approaching,
 and they then immediately betook themselves tu
 the barrack.
 The in argents pouneed upon the clothes box
 cs of the men. which they broke open with large
 stones, and then deliberately proceeded to array
 themselves in the various articles of apparel
 which they found therein, throwing away the old
 clothes w hich they had previously worm They
 then demanded a surrender of the policemen's
 arms, but the constables, eight in numlier, had
 l*eeu occupying themselves in making the arran
 i gements for defence, the trick of which they were
 i so well taught by Mr. Trent at Farrnnrery, and
 j accordingly replied to the demand by tiring u
 volley at the besiegers. Just at this critical mo
 ment i he eight policemen w ho formed the Nine
 mile-house party, and who were on tlieir inarch tc
 Garrick, arrived at Gleubower. They inmiedia
 tcly gave the in-urgent* a volley in the rear, and
 the fellows did not stand to receive their furth i
 compliments, but ran away in .all directions. Twt
 men fell befoie the barrack—one of them was
 wounded, and the coiistablary made him a pris
 oner; the other was killed on the spot. The lat
 ter was a person living in the neighborhood, and
 well known to the j*o!ioe. He had upon his feel
 a pair of boots rifled from one of the boxes, and
 his own old brogues were found where he had
 thrown them by the read side w hen he had fitted
 him-eil inoie to his liking. An old woman, w hom
 I met at the place, stated that she was looking on
 I the entile engagement, and that after the boys’
 ran, one of them, w hilst crossing the hill, was
 struck by’ a ball from tiie barrack, and fell, but
 got up again, and was assisted off' by Ins coin
 redes. JSlie also said that sev&lt; ral others of the
 attacking p.uty were believed to have been
 wounded.
 'I lie constabulary party of the Nine-mile house
 remained at Gleubower, fearing that they might
 be interrupted m tlieir march to Garrick; and an
 intimation of the precarious condition w as con
 veyed to Sub-liisjiector Trent, at Gillian, by a
 letter entrusted to the guard of the Gork and kil
 k -nny mail, which passed soon after the skirmish.
 Upon the receipt of this billet immediate prepar
 ations were made of going for the rescue of the
 constables.
 A {Million of the 57tli regiment was encamped
 at Gallan, and the laud quarters of the 83dhad
 arrived from Kilkenny, en route for Fermoy.—
 Notwithstanding the fatigue of the days’s march
 already sustained, two companies of the lattei
 gallant corps turned out with the utmost alac
 rity and cheerfulness and two companies of the
 Toth, and about thirty jxdioemen, under command
 of I'. Make, Esq., G. L, and Thomas Trent, K*q
 i S. I. proceeded to Gleubower. They, however,
 found that the constabulaiy had left previous to
 their arrival, having been relieved by a company
 of the 3d Buffs, and a company of the 6od from
 j Garrick, who came to their assistance on jaunting
 I cars soon as the news of their danger reache
 that town, and made prisoners of several people
 whom they found congregated near the Glen
 i-ower station. Thtse meu, though f**und in this
 position, were not armed, and we believe ni
 charge will be sustained against them. The 75th
 and 83d, w ith the Callun constabulary, bivouchee
 for the night at Gleubower, in the open a.r.
 On the follow iag morning communications
 were held with the troops m Garrick, touching tin
 advisability of marching from either point on tin
 hill of Aheny, and giving the insurgents battle]
 j however, upon making observati *ns of the ground
 it wa9 lovud that the rebel force had evucuatei
 the camp, and disappeared into the various wood
 and mountain pasaei of the district, to dislodgi
 v them from which, w ould require a much large
 force, and more matured plan of operation. Ac
 1 cordingly, the troops and police returned fron
 Gleubower to Cullan to-day, and I believe the 83t
 is to continue its march to Fethearad to-morrow
 You will perceive from this statement that thi
 reports in from Kilkenny last night, and whicl
 j were conveyed chiefly by’ fugitives from th
 neighborhood of Kilinoganhy, were much exag
 gcrated; and 1 believe that the numbe
 i of insurgents actually appearing in arms wa
 much overrated. The |*ofice were no where uis

 The accounts about the state of the corn crop- j
 are uniform, that the wheat and oats are average
 and the weather so favorable as to insure their
 being gathered in in safety. The same liolds of
 the hay. But the accounts of tlie potatoes are
 more conflicting; arising partly from the differ
 dice of different soils, partly from the different
 stages in which the crop i\ partly from the cir
 cumstance that some, in which the disease is in
 cipient, appear sound when dug, and become
 tainted when kept; but,altogether, the prospect
 is less promising tLin a few weeks ago, -uid the
 fact of tlie existence of th 4 disease universally,
 though different in the extent of its ravages and
 the stages of its progress, justifies the alarm that
 Li felt, ami the timely a Iviee of the Agricultural
 Society to sow turnips on the stubble land and
 potato ground for spring use, when, it is to b
 feared. the potatoes will have been exh.iuste l, a
 far as the poor are concerned.
 But, lo! on the eve of the trials, and in the
 country around the scene where they are to take
 place, an insurreCion has again broken ont, appa
 rently coverfliga wider extent th in the one that
 has only just been suppressed. The tidings of it
 i came most unexpectedly; nor is it easy to ac
 j count for it, whether the object lie politieaf, a*
 j some assert, a diversion, to prevent the trials; or
 a scheme of the government, got up by their se
 eret agents, especially I)*heriv, who is said to lx*
 in their service, and hence not taken, though £3OO
 are offered for his apprehension, as well as for
 that of the others, who are caught or have fled,
 the police having secret instructions to let him
 alone, the design being to insure a conviction,
 with the utmost penalty of the law, when the
 trials do take place. Others allege, the move
 ment to lie af/r srian, caused by the severe opera
 tion oi the poor laws; the commissioners insist
 ing u| x»n the repayment of the loan, and the pro
 j prietors being unable both to pay the rate and
 I employ laborers; and “clearing out” the small
 I holders, and, at the same time, driving for the
 rent, seizing upon all the produce of the harvest,
 !or the price, as fast as it is .sold And, finally, it
 is supposed by others, that the impelling motive
 j of this most insane attempt is the hope of plun
 -1 der; the whole of that wild, mountainous, law
 less region selected by Smith O'Brien and his as
 sociates tor the commencement of the rebellion,
 having been ever since unsettled, the people in
 general not turning to work, nor surren let ing
 their arms. In the present ca-e, tlte farmers are
 compelled to supply provisions, the present lead
 dt e whom er they may be, not having any of the j
 f scruples of Smith O'Brien about levying contri j
 buttons; his high feeling of hon &gt;r, in till re.-pect, j
 jit is said, being one main cause of his failure. 1
 The numbers abroad are said to be greater than
 t in the former eimnte, and the outbreak to cover a
 wider range of country. But all the accounts
 are vague, many c-mtradictory. This much i
 certain, that the scene embraces the district whore
 the three counties of Kilkenny, Waterford, and
 j Tipperary touch; that there are two mob codec
 j tioui, which the country pajiers call “cncmnp
 j meats,” the one on Slievonamou, the other at Kil
 i aiacthomas; and rum ir lias it, that Doheuy is a
 j inong tlie former, and O’Mahony among tlie lat
 ter.
 The only conflicts have been with the police—
 -1 Balhngarry on a small scale; the object being to
 i get the arms of the p**li- e, and the result being a
 fiiluie, an some shot in the attempt. Tlte nidi
 tary, that had been in process of withdrawment.
 i are now rapidly concentrating upon the spot, and
 I fear there will be, as tlie dcnoavmxU to ihi
 mad an l meaningless attempt, a terribly destr.ic
 tive ovcriweepitig of the country, and alterxvarJs
 the c-tahlLshmcfit of muriial law.
 j As 1 close, the reports brought down by the
 mail train are that along the line all is quiet, and
 the crowds di-per-c-L Not a doubt of it. They
 i will not come to blows; but the military will not
 leave the neighborhood till they have given it a
 J more minute and searching scrutiny tliu.ii before,
 and 1 fear that some terrible examples will be
 made of the offenders. There is something most
 unfeelingly appalling in the men that could seton
 foot such a movement, tlie effect of which must be
 material detriment to the cause of the men about
 to be tried, brethren in the sentiments and feel
 ings they entertained.
 Hr. Butt lias liad notice served on the Govern
 ment pro-eeutors, to produce the contents of S.
 O’Brien’s portmanteau, said to contain letters
 from many of the Roman Catholic Clergy, and not
 a few laymen, whom the Government had rather
 M not bring before the public. He thus places them
 1 in a dilemma, for if they decline, it will create, in
 many quarters, a prejudice against the Govern
 ment, a sympathy for him.
