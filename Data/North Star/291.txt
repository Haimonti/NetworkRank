 Fr&lt;m an Address delivered before ike badin'
 Idttrory and Progmnre A*toaatnm of
 thf City of Buffalo, .V. V'., by G r.otor
 Wcit, Jr., on TVeWoy evening, April IT.
 In presenting myself before von this eve
 ning. 1 shill briefly invite your attention back
 six thousand years, when the structure known
 as the globe which wo now occupy was
 without shape oi comeliness—when the now
 expansive ocean was not created, or the firma
 ment which now stretches itself over our
 heads had come from the hands of the living
 God. He spake, and behold a promiscuous
 dark fluid, an unformed chaos, or gloomy
 mass of substance, such as had never before
 existed. And the voice of God, from the
 midst thereof, said, “Let there be light," and
 at his command the misty darkness was dis
 pelled, and light shone around. His own
 almighty mind then eontemplaud the vast
 ness of his pur;K&gt;sc. He viewed with pleas
 ure and delight the glory diua shed around
 Him; and again spake, and the light wa*
 separated from the darkness.
 God then proceeded, in his divine wisdom, to
 plan the great universe, complete in all its
 parts, a* we now behold it—the sun, the
 moon, the stare, and all the various works
 which beautify and adorn the natural world.
 There are various conjectures as to the time
 «.f creation. The most learned and eminent
 men have differed in this matter. While
 Capelins and others would have the creation'
 commenced in the spring about the Nth of
 April, the great Usher would have it in the'
 fall. According to I’sher*** calculations, he
 would have us date the commencement on the j
 •&gt;2d day of October, or Tisti; while other3,|
 equally as eminent —such as Scaliger and.
 Spanhcim —would have us date from about,
 the-first of September, or Ebul. It is evi
 dent, however, that their calculations have all j
 been made long subsequent to creation, and
 ns such are involved in doubt. Philosophical
 and mathematical calculations, which arc the
 only true sources Irom which authentic in- 1
 formation can be derived, long since failed toj
 harmonize and as it is-a matter ot no pecul-&lt;
 iar interest to us, we need not waste our lime
 in following the airy notions of others into
 I lie abyss o! despondency, but let us attend to
 matters more susceptible of development, and
 such as arc more easily and readily ascer
 tained, and, when ascertained, are of more
 importance to us.
 We find, in the great work of creation,j
 that when God, by his infinite wisdom, hadi
 spoken into existence this immense fabiic,|
 he stood in the midst thereof, and pronounced i
 it good. 15ut ihe great master-piece of his!
 work had not yet been performed—the great i
 human machinery had not yet been put in
 action. No mortal voice had been beard to
 lisp the praise of Him to whom all praise be
 longed. Then God said, Ix:t us make
 man," and by his own hands he formed man
 out of the dust of the earth, and breathed
 into lus nostril? the breath of eternal life.
 And while man was sole possessor
 of the earth, (for into his hands all beings,
 both animate and inanimate, were committed,),
 God, in his compassion, moved in his behall,
 and caused a deep sleep to fall upon him,
 while from his side he look her, the guardian
 angel of his every care. And we might here
 be allowed to remark, that in this the wisdom
 of God was most wonderfully displayed, evi
 dently intending to show the nearness and
 close alliance of the one to the other, and a
 direct confutation of the miserable doctrine,
 so universally and so erroneously indulged in,
 of woman’s inferiority toman. Woman was
 not taken from the head, nor yet from the
 feet of man, but from his side and as from
 his side was she taken, so by his side shall
 she stand, and with him shall she walk,
 despite the stupid fanaticism of those who
 would ignorantly undervalue her worth.
 We are led, in taking this cursory
 view* of creation, to behold with wonder the
 beautiful and multiform works around us
 And no man, unless he be clothed with a
 inind of sensuality and skepticism—unless he
 be dead to every principle of humanity, and
 lost to every vesiige of sane reasoning, could
 or would even dare dispute the existence ol
 an infallible and living God, the superstruc
 ture of whose hands meets our astonished
 vision at every gaze. Unlike the works ol
 art, the more it is explored, the more it opens
 to our view sources of admiration—the more
 it calls for our inspection—the more it de
 mands our praise aud whether we turn to
 the right or to the left—whether we at a
 glance encircle within our vision the green
 clad valleys, or the rustic mountain tops, or
 whether, with John in Paimos, as a sea ol
 glass, we behold the waters of the mighty
 ocean, and ihen, in our imagination, pene
 trate the ethereal blue," and like the adopted
 son of Pharaoh’s daughter, lay hold upon the
 shining garments of a Deity and hold com
 munion there—whether on Pisgah’s spicy
 brow we view the landscape o’er,” or from
 Mount Carmel, the home of the Prophets, we
 gaze upon the way-worn pilgrim as he de
 scends as a herald of salvation, while the
 dews of heaven glisten upon his garments,
 or whether we turn our eyes from those de
 lightful scenes, and consent to listen for a
 moment to the frantic wail from the dismal
 abode—we cannot but exclaim, in the lan
 guage of the psalmist—“ How wonderful are
 thy works, O I thy ways are past finding
 out.” The philosopher may here find an un
 funded field of pleasure aud delight; the
 mathematician may here vainly endeavor to
 calculate the innumerable blessings of God
 while the poet may sing with ecstacy of de
 light, the sacred anthems of eternal praise;
 and when men upon earth have tuned theii
 harps ;&lt;nd raised their highest notes, angels
 with propriety may become enraptured with
 delight—their heavenly choruses raaj swell
 the song, while unutterable joys shall nog
 through the mansion* of eternal bliss, and
 then, tn the language of the poet, “His love
 can ne’er be told.”
 And were we to appeal more directly to
 Christians, they certainly would agree that
 to them tins field presents iudf clothed to the
 richest verdure of Heave., ow o ordaining.-
 F° them, every brook sparkling at the
 mountain base becomes a beacon, and every
 pebble on the bed of the chrysul stream a
 meaaeoger to point them to ie ]znA of
 promise.
 God, in the economy of his w isdom, having
 thus beautifully and gloriously formed Ow
scenery hr which we are surrounded, must of
 course have had some definite and primary
 object in view; and suet wan none other
 than the happiness of man and the glorifiea
 tion of himself. Such, mj friends, was the
 greet end in view; and for this was the forms'
 tion of all this vast nod mighty globe. The
 whole paraphernal* and machinery of God’s
 entire universe has been consummated for this
 oos important purpose. And in view of this,
 then, bow great and important is the responsi
 bility resting on ns!
 We are thus naturally led to inquire. How
 shall man serve the great end of his cre
 ation 1 How shall he serve to promote the
 happiness of his fellow man, and the glorifi
 cation of God 1 We answer .without alluding
 particularly to spiritual duties, —that it is the
 duty of man to seek to promote the interest
 of bis fellow man, by endeavoring in every
 respect m ameliorate and better his condition.
 Our earthly prospects and ambition, the ob
 jects of our highest natural attammems, our
 most sincere and devoted purposes so far aa
 they comport with justice and reason, should
 be cored for and regarded by a)! the very
 construction of our natures demands this of os
 as an imperative obligation. And where we
 fail to conform to it,we virtually set aside, aod
 by our actions deny the great end of our cre
 ation. We should be careful to advance the
 interest of each other by bearing aach other’s’
 burdens. Wc should endeavor to aid thosej
 in distress. We should administer to the
 wants of the needy. We should extend the
 helping hand and mingle the sympathising!
 tear with those in adverse or afflicted eirenm
 j stances. And thus in our hands prosper the
 great cause of humanity.
 And 1 might here remark, that one of the*
 i .rrrat means for the attainment of such endai
 is that for which your Society has been form- j
 ed. The grand principle upon which your
 Institution has been based, is that of the dis
 semination of light and knowledge. You
 have organized for the purpose of thrusting in
 the sickle of truth and mowing down the'
 base meadows of corruption which too often
 ripen in our midst. And should you be led
 on to a successful terminus, you may safely
 be said to he one of the springs from which
 emanates the true character which shall honor
 his creation by seeking the happiness of man
 and the glorification of God. Education is
 the great moral leveler. It elevates the down!
 trodden to a position sufficiently eminent,!
 while it reduces the proud and haughty to the
 same eminence. Pride, arrogance, deceit and
 superstition are compelled to lice from before
 it, or in its onward course it will crush them
 to pieces, and fiery darts from the magazine o!
 wisdom shall consume the last atom thereof.
 Education is the summary of light, knowledge
 i and understanding the natural promptings
 thereof are peace, union, love and harmony.
 The religion of Jesus Christ, in a great meas
 ure owes its happy and heavenly progress to
 Education. Our domestic and foreign Mis
 sionary Societies afford abundant evidence of
 this fact. The herald of Christ who folds
 his bible to his bosom and launches out upon
 the Pacific, fulfilling the Divine command
 of, Go ye into all the world and preach my j
 Gospel to every creature,” must not only be
 endowed with the grace of God, but must}
 also have a plentiful supply of wisdom from i
 the store-house of earthly knowledge. And j
 the same is true of your domestic missiona- j
 ries, your ministers of the gospel, your laity
 as well as your clergy; and men in all the va-!
 tious ramifications of society need in a great
 measure this inestimable boon, in OTder the
 more successfully to complete the great end
 iof their being. And it is a fact, that religion
 andfeducation are so closely allied that without
 the latter the former cannot successfully be
 spread; while upon the other hand, the latter
 is greatly indebted to the former. We learn i
 that the preservation of the entire code of
 dead languages may be attributed to the zeal-1
 ous and unreserved efforts of the ancient i
 Christians. They collected and preserved with!
 great care the original versions of the old Tes- i
 lament, which in more modem times have I
 been translated into our various languages, i
 and become the savour of lile unto life to!
 many that have believed and obeyed the truths
 herein contained Shortly after the return of
 the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, Ezra
 j collected as many copies as he could of the
 sacred writings, and out of them all, prepared
 a correct edition, which was published in the
 Chaldee” character, that language having
 j been substituted for the Hebrew.” The
 division of the Scriptures into chapters is of
 more modern date, and was introduced during
 the ieign of Henry the Third, about the year
 i 1240. About the year 1445, Mordecai Na*
 than, a learned Jewish Rabbi,drew up a con
 r cot dance to the Hebrew' of Chaldaic Bible,
 I and having observed Hugo’s division of chap
 ters, and being desirous of still more improve
 ment, he divided chapters into verses, which
 I method has been followed to the present time.
 1 bus we find that the Jews borrowed the di
 vision of the Holy Scriptures into chapters
 from the Christians, while in like manner the
 i Christians boriowed that of chapters into ver
 ses from the Jews.
 Remove education from our land and wha
 would be our condition l Our halls of Jegisla
 tion and judicial tribunals would become
 doubly base and corrupted for no man is
 competent to administer justice who has not
 I first learned justice himaelf. The law of our
 land in order to be honorably and faithfully
 dispensed roust first be made familiar with
 r those from whose hands it shall be adminis
 tered, and a deep study and anxious solicitude
 is the only sure guaranty of their fitness.—
 Were the administration of our laws loft to
 persons uneducated, and upon whom the ris
 ing cun of intellect as well as judgment had
 never shone, oar moral luminary would be
 i coroe darkened, and the light of equity which
 now measurably illuminates the horizon, would
 i become entirely extinguished. No man is
 I fully prepared to take his station in society
 under any circumstances, unless to a greater
 I or loss degree he becomes educated. It is
 true he may pass through his home circle, be
 may be respected by those around him, his
 i acts of charity and benevolence may gain for
 i him an enviable reputation, his Christian de
 port ment may be regarded as worthy of imi
 tation, and upon the whole be may be esteem
 ed as a good and worthy citizen. But place
 that individual io a responsible station, de
 maod of him duties which require more thsn
 natural attainment?, and you fold him deficient;
 bis natural ability cannot supply the place ot
 learning, and be consequently is left without
 Lmm
Wheaesei we see the temple of science fif
 ing up anraud t», we there also see the de
 molition of the base fabric of ignorance and
 superstition; and though as but the sums of a
 man's band the son!! deed of science may
 begin to arise, yet if it is fanned by the brew*
 of persereranee. buoyed up by hope and ex
 pectation, it will continue as did the me«*eft
 get of God's wrath over the guilty anteriiiavi
 aus, to expand until it shall haTe core-red the
 entire woild, and the drippings thereof shall
 not be as waters from the angry clouds, but’
 shall be, as I hare already remarked, Peace,
 Union, Lore and Harmony. These are the!
 legitimate results or benefits arising therefrom.
 The foundation of this great and massive!
 temple has for centuries been laid. Its work
 men are continual.j building upon jt, yet its!
 walls hare scarce been reared, above the
 ground, and time alone will complete the edi-‘
 fice. It requires more workmen. The de-j
 maud is made upon every one to assist in car
 rying up the walls; and when this is done,
 when every mao, as the beating anvil to the!
 stroke, has been true to his duty, and when!
 generations shall bare spent their pilgrimage!
 in adding to this structure, “then shall be
 unfolded new duties, and generations suc
 ceeding generations--shall be called upon to
 add taste and Behold you
 lofty temples, whose spires pierce the clouds,
 and by their dazzling beauty invite the inspec
 tion of heavenly seraphs and we trace their
 commencement back to the apostolic age, to
 the days of Andrew, Peter, James and John,:
 the despised but bumble fishermen of Galiiiee.
 In obedience to the divine couimad of theit
 Savior, filled with zeal and perseverance, they
 went forth to establish and build up the Chris
 tian church, of which Jesus Christ was the
 foundation ana at that time, corn cribs and
 palm shades of the region of Judea were their
 only temples; but nerved by ambition, they
 persevered, continually increasing in power
 and might, while through the channels of
 education have been opened daily improve
 ments; and we now, instead of the corn crib,
 behold the massive temples, in whose courts*
 may be sung the praises of our great Creator, j
 The rapid strides that education and science!
 have made through our land, might almost be
 said to be incredible, were it not that our eyes
 behold the glory thereof
 But comparatively a few years ago and the
 power of steam in navigating our waters wa«&gt;
 unknown while the cities of the old world,
 and islands of the sea, which were then far
 away, have by this agency been brought nigh;
 and distant lands, dedicated to heathenism and
 idolatry, have seemingly been brought within
 our own borders, while the power of Moloch
 has been smitten, and the nappy influences ol
 Christianity have been shed around.
 The art of printing, this powerful engine;
 of reform, has but for a short time been!
 known, and the good effects arising therefrom;
 are indeed incalculable. Our railroads, our!
 canals, and our more modern improvement ol
 the telegraph, all combine to show the power i
 of science and education. And it would be i
 vain for us to undertake to calculate the many
 benefits which are the natural and legitimate
 results thereof. But suffice it to say, that the
 performance of what was once considered im
 possible, tias now become universal; anti ail
 these, together with the royal thrones of the
 )Jd world, in all their splendor, and the great
 rollossal temple, the American Republic, are
 iut a glorious forshadowing of man's ultimate
 lestiny. It may be said to be hut a rose in J
 •he wreath of moral, civil and political glory,
 which is yet to encircle the globe and but a 1
 few centuries will elapse before the beauty j
 »nd brilliancy of this now proud Republic shall j
 have passed away, and shall be superseded
 by beauties far more excellent, more rational
 in their character, and free and humane in
 their principles. This is an age of progressive
 improvement, and under the present circum
 stances, you might as weli undertake lo snatch
 the moon from its orbit, or disrobe the sun of
 its mantle of glory, as to undertake to stopj
 the machinery now in action, bringing about
 by its daily revolutions new scenes, to be 1
 looked upon with wonder and admiration. I
 And befoie the glory of this Republic shall!
 depart, or before her joys shall bo made full,
 a new chapter shall be revealed, a new event
 shall be commemorated, and a bright star shall
 glisten in her diadem. Freedom to the cap
 tive shall be proclaimed throughout the length
 and breadth of her borders, while the smiling
 genius of universal liberty shall perch itsell
 upon her banners, and enshroud her golden j
 wings amid the stars and stri|&gt;es which tri
 umphantly shall float amid the spicy breezes of
 our own happy land. Slavery and despotism
 shall cease to sway its mightv sceptre ovet
 ooi country, and the grateful hearts of the
 American people shall make a willing sacrifice
 of this “demi-god,” baptized as he is in the
 blood of millions, upon the sacred abars ol
 liberty. .The hand-writing upon the wall has
 already been seen, and by using the means
 within our power, by drinking deep at the
 fountain of wisdom, we shall greatly hasten
 the day; and ere we are aware of it, the aus
 picious morn will usher in upon us, and we
 shall then be enabled, as citizens and freemen,
 to enjoy the fruit of our labor.
 In view of this, then, ladies, persevere!—
 Your influence in this matter will be felt and
 realized both far and near, and will have a
 powerful effect upon the future destiny of this
 city. The rising generations which now be
 hold your efforts, will have occasion in after
 year* to point to your course as one eminent!}
 worthy. But, through careiessuess or inat
 tention, should you fail in your undertakings,
 your failure will prove a clog in the whjel of
 reform, which for years will impede us pro
 gress But by perseverance, as did the nobit
 matrons of Rome, sosha'l you be enabled U&gt;
 see the works of your hands prospering arourni
 you and thoogh you may uot, as did the
 Roman women, sec throne* and kingdoms
 totter and fall at your command, yet fro
 your presence ignorance and superstition,
 which i* the corrupting moth that undermines
 sad saps the foundation of political glory,
 shall banish as by magic, and the demoralizing
 ▼ices of onr land, though deep-rooted, shall
 be {docked up; the ploughshare of truth,
 skilfully guided by the hand of your Associa
 tion. shall ron deep in the furrow, overturning
 sad exposing to the scorching son of coo
 tempt, which, by its heating rays, will soon
 wither both root and branch A halo of light
 and glory shall encircle your heads, and your
 pathway shaU become bril taut in consequence
 of the happy influences shed around you; the
 good and virtuous of belt and shall heap gar

The following kite* addressed to a dear
 friend, just arrived in this country from Eng
 land. will he read with interest by the traderm
 of the North Star-
 Losoos, April 9th, 1949.
 Doubtless as the shore* of Britain receded
 and gradually sank beneath the protoberant
 waters, yon felt a becoming emotion: for you
 were leaving the land of your bmb and your
 kindred, and those that do not love this, can
 knre nothing strongly.
 Before this reaches your eye another father
 land has adopted you—the land of the Pil
 grim Fathers who peopled it; bat it was not
 they who peopled it with slaves—no, they
 had suffered too much form the worst of sla
 very, of the mind,to introduce it into free
 dom's only refuge then hnt, benevolence is
 m*t hereditary.
 When musing upon the antipathy of the
 western world to men of color, as the sable
 races are inaptly called, for black is the ab
 sence of color, 1 keep down the rising disgust
 by looking at home, where proscription as
 hateful prevails, only creed here instead of
 color is the cause. Those who do not believe
 with the Court, the Nobles, and the wealthy
 —who do not worship a&lt;*cording to act of par
 liament —whose prayers are not in the words
 set forth in the transition state between Po
 pery and Protestantism—these races who pre
 sumptuously think for themselves, are in a
 condition analagous to those in the United
 States upon whom “the sun has looked.”
 The former find the Universities and very
 many of the endowed asylums for the aged
 and necessitous “taboed” against them, and
 in all public |nations, they perceive them
 selves deemed below the level of equality.
 The difference in the two proscriptions is
 more in degree than m kind, but in one res
 pect the contumely and insult which are the
 lot of the man of color are more indefensible,
 inasmuch as the tinge of his skin is not under
 his (ontrol; henci his repudiation combines
 absurdity with weakness.
 What would be thought if a portion of the
 community were to pass a conventional resolu
 tion, to keep aloof from all persons having
 hair of a certain color, or noses of certain
 forms and dimensions? Yet the eolorphobia
 is equally irrational and revolting.
 It was with delight I read in the recent A
 merican papers, that a star of hope ha 3 risen
 above the dark horizon of Kentucky. Be of
 i good cheer then ye children of bondage! the
 deliverance of those that groaned under the
 taskmasters of the Nile, was once far more
 unlikely, than the emancipation of the sons of
 i Ham on the banks of the Savannah, or the
 shores of the Chesapeake.
 Europe is still agitated. The former fer
 mentation of 1818 threw tho people up, but
 that of 181!) seems to precipitate them to the
 bottom again. Austria, Prussia, Russia, Den
 maik, Naples, and Spain are disposed to coa
 lesce to uplift the prostrate potentates, especi
 al!}’ him of the triple diadem; and republican
 France, and liberty-boasting England seem
 to look calmly on.
 The grand moral to be learned from the re
 action is the incompatibility of a standing ar
 my with freedom. Although soldiers receive
 their pay from the people, by a fiction they
 are called the King’s or Queen’s troops, and
 are always ready to plunge their swords or
 bayonets in the breasts of their maintained,
 whenever the rights of the people are in an
 tagonism with the aggressions of their rulets.
 This inevitable consequence from a standing
 army should stimulate the actors in the move
 ment against war, more than the expense of it.
 What originated the first standing army in
 England l Why a Smart’s desire to he a des
 pot. At his bidding the Guards, both horse
 and foot, were organized as a body guard, and
 1 continue around the Sovereign to the present
 day, under the appellation of household troops;
 the ready instruments for coercing their pay
 masters into submission to tyranny, injustice,
 and exaction. The slaughter during the con
 test of Sir Frahcis Burdett, alone justifies
 this assertion.
 The United States owe the continuance of
 their liberties and equality, to the absence of
 permanent military hirelings. If the execu
 tive governments were disposed to he despotic
 they have no armies to do their bidding; hence
 the people retain the sovereignty, and fortun
 ately for the United States, they have main
 land enough without seeking for transmarine
 colonies, the ready excuse in England for
 maintaining this impoverishing, demoralizing
 and enslaving force.
 I Our domestic affairs aie much in the state
 vou left them—trade and agriculture in an
 i unsatisfactory state, and employment insuffi
 cient for the demand.
 The Exeter Bishop, to quote Punch,”
 still keeps one foot in the see and the other
 on shore." __

Attyltun for the Sifk who have been con
 fined to their beds from I to 20 yearn.
 DR. HAMILTON’S Hydropathic and Anya lytic i
 Asylum, No 217 Exchange Street, opposite' the
 Orphan Asylum, Roehestcr, N.Y, This Institution
 is now firmly established and in successful o|&gt;era
 tion. The proprietor analyzes every disease that is
 admitted there, and applies the natural and appro
 priate remedy. Although water is used in every wav
 that is applied in any water-cure establishment lit
 the United States, yet the proprietor wislies it to he
 expressly understood that it ia not relied on as the ee/y
 or principal lemedy in tlie treatment of disease sub
 mitted to his care.
 This Establishment is designed for that class of
 invalids who have failed to obtain their health by all
 other systems ef practice, and are still unable to
 walk or stand on their feet, and are confined to tlieir
 oeds, wearing out a life of misery and suffering with
 qut any hope of ever being any better.
 The remedies made use of in this Institution not
 only entirely remove disease but give increased,
 strength and elasticity to the system. Many have
 been Drought here from different parts of the coun
 try, who had neither walked or Ijorne their weight
 on their feet from five to fifteen years; arid some
 who have been unable to dress or undress, or even i
 to feed themselves, and in the course of a few weeks
 would lie walking with the elasticity of youth and
 the quickness of a pedestrian, astonished at them-j
 selves, and surprising their friends and all who saw
 them vvheii they first came. The treatment of this
 Institution is particularly calculated to remove the j
 diseases peculiar to females, such as
 Ist. The falling of the Womb, in all its stages
 and conditions in patients, from twelve years of age
 up to sixty, ami even if they have heen confined to
 their beds from one to twenty, unable to stand, walk.
 I dress, or undress themselves, or even too feeble to
 bear any noise or speak aloud.
 2d. Weakness and Falling of die Bowels; Pain
 i in the Side, Shoulders, Back and Head Spinal
 I Diseases, Liver Complaints, Sinking Sensation at
 the Stomach, Palpitation of the Heart, Dyspepsia]
 in all its forms and stages, Piles, Costiveness Di-;
 arrbcea. Suppression of the Mensem, Excessive i
 Menstruation, Whites, all Nervous Diseases, Cold
 Feet and Hands, St. Anthony Dance, Tetters of i
 all kinds, Sait Rheum, in its worst forms, NAiral-.
 gia, Tic Douloureux, Rheumatism, Consumptiod in
 its first stages, General Weakness and Debility.
 The proprietor has given bis whole attention to
 the aliove diseases for the last ten years, and lias
 treated them in an entirely different way from any
 j other private practice or public Institution in this
 country and such has been his siKcess, and so cer-
 taiu are his remedies in their effects on those dis
 eases, that instead of publishing a long list of cer- 1
 1 tified cures, he wishes to give that class of invalids
 seeking to obtain their health a sufficient guarantee
 against any false pretensions, exaggeration, impo
 sition or deception, so that no one need be to any
 expense in this Institution without being tonefited.;
 The proprietor will enter into a special contract
 with any oue who wishes to do so, that he will ad- 1
 nut into the Institution, to advance the inonev aid
 pay all the expense# from any port of the Unite.l
 State# here and back home agaiu, before he com
 mences the treatment, and give a bond to board them,
 together with his professional services, for nothing,
 1 if be does not help them according to contract. Any
 I one thinking the above proposition not a sufficient
 guarantee against inisrepi eseutations and expense
 j without receiving equal benefit, can let the proprie
 tor iuww what wilt be satisfactory, and it shall Is
 duly cm sidered.
 This Institutimi has grown up from private pear-;
 1 tree by the influence of those who have been helped
 t here, as nothing has ever been published before;
 am) the proprietor atlas that it -.ball sustain itseL
 by its own merits, or pay the expense of those who
 I choose to make a amt-net in case of failure. The
 design of thin Circular is not to make known the
 care# that have been mask in this institnuoa, because
 they must soon be bettered; hut to let it he snore
 extensively known to the poor suflrirjag invalid
 that have' spent hundreds of dollars iu trying all
 other systems of practice, and w ithout much or any
 benefit, and stiff remain confined to their hois from
 r five to twenty years, that there is aa Institution
 whose treausrut is different from any other one the
 United Htales, aad is particularly adapted to their
 r situation, and eaa have it emit them nothing unless
 1 thrr a ns materially benefited.
 From the nature of treatment ia this Institution,
 the munher of patients mnst be limited, therefore the
 proprietor dons not solicit the patronage of slight amt
 I ordinary emma which may he eusiH helped l*y other
 systems of practice; nor does he want any one to
 come, ns lets they wish to get weft, aad are wiling
 1 in he made well enough to wait from five to twenty
 1 miles at a time, aad Uho it up day after day in
 l Mccesnioo; aad also willing sole made able to ero
 r dure much labor and fatigue as most of profit
 that caff thmnstlvis wefi, as iUTmeans that every
 one that gaaa thraagh a ttmrwagh canvas ef treatment
 in dm Analytic Imrismiua dill show by their in
 -1 creased strength, eksticky of motion, Irmatu of
 texture, rapnhHity «f emkranee, aad improved
 I btahh. that the treatment in this Institution wfumad
 l ad an the natural laws af my tied matter, and
 ennsnuently its —pwimitj over every other dif
 ferent system of pnwtiee.
