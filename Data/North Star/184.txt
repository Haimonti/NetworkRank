 WHAT IS IT TO BE A SLAVE!
 BY BARNARD EARTOS.
 Hast thou ever asked thyself
 What it is to lie a slave?
 Bought and sold for sordid pelf,
 From tlie cradle to the grave!
 »Tis to know tlie transient powers,
 E’en of muscle, flesh, and bone,
 Cannot in t! y happiest hours,
 Be considered as thine own;
 But thy master’s goods and rh utds.
 Lent to thee for little more
 Than to light hi* selfish battles
 For saine bits of shining ore!
 ’Tis to learn thou hast n heart,
 Beating in that bartered frame,
 Of whose ownership, no part
 Thou const challenge, but in nanie.^
 For the curse of slavery crushes
 Out the life-blood from its core;
 And expends its thr bbiiig gushes
 But to swell another’s store.
 God’s bc.-t gift from heaven above,
 Meant to in ike a heaven on earth,
 Hallow ing, humanmng Love!
 With the ties which thence have birth:
 These can never lie his lot,
 Who, like brutes, is bought and sold;
 Holding such as having not
 On his own the spider’s hold!
 ’Tis to (eel, e’en worse than this,
 If aught worse than this can be,
 Thou hast shrine I, lor bale or blisi.
 An immortal sout in thee!
 But that this undying guest
 Shares thy body’s degradation,
 Until slavery’s bonds, unblest,
 Cheek each kindling aspiration:
 Anti what should have lieeu thy light,
 Shining e’en bey on 1 the grave,
 Turns to darkness Worse than night,
 Leaving thee a hopeless slave!
 Pitch is Slavery! C’ouldst thou I tear
 Its vile bondage? Oh! my brother,
 llow, then, canst thou, wilt thou dare
 To inflict it on another?

 VIHIT TO RABAII Pl RUei K.
 Having spent twenty-four hours ii
 Boston, and seen as much of the vanity
 sin and folly of men as we desired, wi
 proceded to Salem to visit that great
 esl ol all sufferers in Hie whole universe
 On entering her ehnmhcr we could bu
 just discover her form; as she is no
 able to bear the light her windows an
 darkened more than any other sick roon
 1 ever entered; but after being in tin
 room a few minutes we could discen
 every object distinctly, and even ob
 serve the mild and pleasant countenance
 of the sufferer. But how shall we de
 scribe her case? I cannot. It is im
 possible for words to convey a correc
 idea of her state. To understand hei
 wc must see her and hear her. Al
 who have visited her after reading m 3
 former description of her case, say t Ikm
 doubted the truth of the descriptions
 and some of my enemies visited her fo
 the express purpose of detecting am
 exposing falsehood in rnv writings; foi
 they thought it impossible for the ac
 count to he true, but were forced t«
 admit that the truth was not half told
 and could not be told in such a inannei
 as to convey any lively idea of the real
 ity. But to begin:
 Sarah Purbeck has been confined 1'
 years, during which time she has nevei
 been known to sieep one moment, noi
 has there ever been two minutes at i
 time in which her body and limbs have
 been quiet, or when she has been free
 from intense physical suffering. Hei
 disease is universal spasms. But Jet us
 sit down by her bed and observe her as
 she is thrown about by spasms ovei
 which she can have no control. She
 reaches out her left hand which she has
 the use of in some degree, grasps mine
 with a strong, hearty feeling, saying
 i “I am glad to see tiiee, dear brother, J
 have thought of thee a thousand times
 since thou wast here, and feel very
 grateful for thy visits. She then grasps
 the hand of my mate, draws her nearer
 throws her arms about her neck,
 kisses her as fervently as she would an
 own sister or mother who had long been
 absent, thanks her for her kindness in
 calling. At this time as her bones arc
 twitched out and in at the joints by the
 muscles, are heard in any part of the
 room, grinding and snapping one
 against the other, and before her salu
 tation is completed, she is drawn for
 ward and thrown back against the thick
 pillows with such a force that often
 jars the whole house. The moment the
 spasm ceases, she speaks in as mild and
 pleasant a voice as man ever heard,
 asking us to be seated. By the time
 the sentence is completed, her right arm
 is thrown up over her head, and every
 muscle to the ends of her finders, is
 drawn so tight that her arm, hand and
 fingers are as hard and stiff’ as tli &gt;ugh
 they were solid wood; her countenance
 shows that she can hardly avoid scream
 ing aloud, and there her hand must re
 main, in the same position, with her
 shoulder wrenched out at the joint, till
 the muscles relax, or till the spasm,
 acting on some other set of muscles,
 throws her arm into some other pos
 ture.
 It should be remembered that she
 sits up in bed, not having been able tc
 lie down in seventeen years, and hei
 posture while sitting is most uncomfort
 able. Her feet are both drawn bad
 and round by her right side, whicl
 throws her body from the center o
 gravity and thus renders her positior
 irfOre painful, but even here nature ha?
 relieved Iter, for her spine has curvet
 or in some way changed its position, sc
 that instead of being up and down hei
 back is on the left side, and render;
 the more support to her, in her uncom
 fortable posture! This appears to me
 be the work of nature changing, or ac
 commodating herself to circumstan-
 O
 CCS.
 Her spasm ceases, the muscles ol
 her arm relax and she asks for drink,
 yet at the stillest moments there is such
 a continued twitching of the muscles
 that the bed and bedstead are contin
 ally shaking, like the floor of a ma
 chine shop or factory where all
 kinds of machines are kept in motion by
 water or steam. The girl approaches
 her with drink, she reaches her hand to
 aid the girl in placing it to her mouth,
 when another spasm twists her elbow
 out at the joint, and turns the arm be
 low the elbow nearly round. A spot as
 large ns a ’Z,~&gt; cent piece near the elbow
 is as black as though it had been poun
 ded, and as sore, caused by these
 spasms, or the twitching of the arm.
 She appears to b&lt;? in as much pain as
 she can possibly endure without scream
 ing aloud, but the moment the muscles
 relax she speaks as calmly and pleas
 antly as though she were free from pain.
 Again she reaches tor the drink, and
 takes one i&gt;r two swallows, when the
 spasms seize the muscles around the
 throat and she strangles, pants and
 struggles several minutes as though she
 wouid never breathe again, and as soon
 as the sti angling ceases, she coughs
 violently, and sometimes vomits blood!
 Now site is comparatively quiet for a
 few seconds, vet tlie jar like that of a
 machine shop is continual, her elbow
 and shoulder flying out and in at the
 joints, like the springs of machinery.
 Again a spasm draws iier forward and
 then throws her back against the pillows
 with a violence tiiat one wouib think
 must stun her, and the next moment her
 jaw is drawn out of joint by other mus
 cles, and the moment that spasm cea
 ses. her hand tlies up against her face,
 with so much force that one would
 think the blow enough to stagger c
 strong man. One eye has thus been
 beaten out and her lace is often “black
 and blue lroni these blows; the next
 moment her arm M thrown around be
 hind her and presse d against her back
 with such force that it would be diffi
 cult to press a case knife between her
 arm and back, her hand, arm and all
 the fingers are as stiff’ and as hard as
 wood, and the poor creature must suff
 er till some other muscle coutracts and
 throw s her into some other posture.
 1 bus the sufferer has been tormented
 with spasms day and night during sev
 enteen years without one minute inter
 mission except when exhausted nature
 has fainted away, and even then her
 limbs are twitching about and out and
 in at the joints times without number.
 Sometimes the spasms throw her from
the bed to the plastering overhead, and
 sometimes on to the floor. Many o(
 her joints have been dislocated hun
 dred* and perhaps thousands of times,
 and the lightest spasms are attended
 with pain similar to that caused by the
 severest rramp, and she says if she
 would give way to her feelings her
 screams would be heard half a mile.
 At one time her jaws were firmly locked
 twenty-five days, during which time all
 the nourishment she took passed
 through tho aperture caused by the loss
 of a tooth. She has not swallowed s
 particle of solid food for years, but sub
 sists entirely on liquids, which are ta
 ken with great difficulty and sufiering,
 and she is not conscious of having
 slept a moment for seventeen years'
 and has not been a moment withoul
 pain.
 Singular as all this is, there are oth
 er things equally astonishing. How
 she has lived all this time? is a ques
 tion that has puzzled all that have evei
 seen her. A stranger on seeing her, il
 he had no knowledge of her history,
 would not suppose she could live sis
 hours, and yet there she has been sev
 enteen years, day and night in contin
 ual motion, and never free from pain.
 When 1 expressed surprise at, her liv
 ing so long and enduring so much, she
 replied “it is as great a miracle as was
 ever performed by Christ in the days ol
 .his flesh.”
 Another mystery to many is, how her
 mind is kept so quiet and patient, as no
 inurmer or complaint ever escapes her
 lips: but on the contrary she is perfect
 ly resigned to her lot, and says she has
 no desire to have one pain the less, but
 is willing to drink the whole cup with
 resignation. She believes her Heav
 enly Father is ever present, secs and
 know s all her sufferings and is fulfilling
 some wise purpose.
 But I must draw this article to a
 close and yet the truth is not hall
 told.
 And now, reader, can it be believed
 that in this nation of high profession, in
 the wealthy town of Salem, amid religi
 ous churches and the profesedly pious,
 this poor sufferer, in the midst of ali
 her sufferings must have the care of a
 family, a father over JK) years of age
 and herself and nurse—and keep her
 purse in bed and order the purchases
 of the family and settle all her bills?
 Can it be believed that she is compell
 ed, among professed Christians, to de
 pend in part on transient gtfts ‘or sup
 port? that she is often out of
 besides her other sufferings has
 ditional worrinient of being in dent,
 without knowing whence means will
 come for her relief! It is even so, and
 this of itself is sufficient comment on
 the state of pure Christianity in the
 community,and is sufficient proofofthe
 truth of all the hard things I have said
 about the churches.
 After spendi ig three or four hours
 with the poor sufferer, we arose to de
 part when she again grasped my com
 panion by the hand, drew her nearer,
 threw her arm about ber neck, kissed
 her and wept aloud! O! it is better te
 visit that chamber of suffering than the
 house of feasting.
 I handed her two dollars, one from
 J. Hammond, of Shirley, Mass., and
 one from friend B. of New York, and
 could but wish that it had been ten
 times as much. 4
 If any one doubts any part the above
 relation let him write to the Selectmen
 of Salem, or any other person, and he
 will be told that the account is true!
 and if any who may read this article
 may have a desire to express his sym
 pathy for her by contributing to supply
 her wants, they inay direct to me, or to
 Sarah Purbeck, Salem, Mass.
 After bidding her adieu, we entered
 the car and soon arrived at our quiet
 cabin, feeling that our time had been
 exchanged for that which is of more
 value than silver or gold.

 MATERNAL COURAGE.
 We have rarely, if ever, met with a
 more striking example of maternal
 self-devotion, united with a singular
 presence of mind,-than is offered by
 the following circumstance which oc
 curred two or three weeks ago in the
 Slate of New York. The extracts
 which we give are made, as will be
 perceived, from a letter written by the
 heroic mother herself to a friend, a few
 days after the events narrated had oc
 curred.
 Mrs. accompanied by her
 daughter, a young girl about twelve
 years of age, and some young children,
 with their nurses, went to visit
 cemetery. A favorite dog, nanied
 Carlo, was permitted to accompany
 them as escort, and the little ones were
 amused by their gambols as he ran and
 leaped by their side. On reaching the
 cemetery, Mrs. and her daugh
 ter were a little in advance of the rest
 of the party.
 When suddenly we were all arrest
 ed by the most horrible yelps from Car
 lo, who came plunging, writhing, and
 foaming, furiously mad. The dog took
 a circuit round, and as the shrieks
 went forth from and
 ‘He is mad! he is inad,’l echoed,
 Ves, he is mad—run for your lives!'
 In the same breath, I tore from my
 shoulders a large blanket shawl, as my
 only defence. Carlo immediately made
 for Mary, who was running with all the
 speed possible, i shrieked, ‘Mary, 'tis
 vou he pursues turn as quick as
 thought.’ At the same time, I kept
 nearly pace with the d&gt;g, and, as dear
 Mary turned, I enveloped him com
 pletely with iny shawl, winding the
 corners (which I held in my hand for
 the purpose) closely round his neck.—
 It was, ol course, only for one moment
 1 could hold him, but every instant
 count! d, and enabled Marv to change
 her course, so that he was unable *to
 pursue her in any direct liue. But the
 instant be escaj&gt;ed from me, he made
 direct for her again, a frothy foam is
 suing from his tn »ulh, accompanied bv
 that unearthly yelp.
 I he others had made their escape
 from the comet cry, and 1 was left alone
 among the dead, to contend with, and
 protect my child against, a raving mad
 dog. Oh, who can imagine my feel
 ings! Calm and perfectly self-pos
 sessed, I remained, giving directions
 unceasingly to Mary, who followed them
 quicker than given. All the time the
 dog was at full speed, save when I
 muffled him with the vkawl. It w»-
only by Mary** making short turn* an
 leaping upon palings that I had an op
 portunity of stopping him at all.
 Several time* be *o nearly reached her
 as to raise his paws to spring np to the
 spot she occupied, and each lime
 strength and thought were given to me
 to cover him with the shawl and wind, it
 round his neck. Thus she escaped
 until aid was sent. Kven that, I fear,
 might have been too late, had he not
 fallen ir a fit, from which be was never
 allowed to rise.» His head waaaevered
 from his body by the heavy bWw of an
 axe, given by a strong arm, while Mary
 stood directly over him, upon a high
 i fence, whither be had pursued her.
 One week has passed, and. last
 night was the first time I have been
 able to shut out from my sight that fu
 rious dog, gnashing his jaws, uttering
 those horrid yelps, and foaming thick
 froth from his mouth, rushiug after my
 poor child.
 In the midst of the horrors of the
 scene described with such simplicity
 and vividness, how touchingly sublime
 appears a mother’s love! Again and
 again the mother offers her life in sac
 rifice for that of her child. Each time
 that t.e shawl was throw n around the
 furious animal, he might have turned
 upon that noble woman and made her
 his victim, yet still she persevered,
 and God in mercy made her the instru
 ment of saving the life of her beloved
 daughter.
 One word on the remarkable pres
 ence of mind here displayed. It is a
 quality w hich all should cultivate. It is
 invaluable in the hour of danger. And
 who knows when that hour may be at
 hand? The timid and irresolute are in
 imminent peril themselves, and entirely
 useless to others, while those who have
 learned to maintain a control over their
 thoughts and preserve presence of
 mind, are often made the happy instru
 ments of saving those whom they love
 from danger and from death. X.
 The Secret or Success. —lt may
 to some appear like vanity in me to
 write what I now do, but I should not
 give my life truly if I omitted it. When
 I tilling a cart of manure at the farm
 dunghill, I never stopped work because
 I my side of tire cart might be heaped
 up before the other side, at which was
 another man I pushed over what I
 had heaped up to help him, as doubtless
 he did to help me, when I was last and
 he was first. When I have filled my
 column or co'unns of a newspaper, or
 sheet of a magazine with the literature
 for which I was to be paid, I have
 never stopped if the subject required
 more elucidation, or the paper or maga
 zinc more matter, because there was
 |no contract for more payment, or no
 likelihook of there being more. When
 I have lived in barrack-room, I liave
 stopped my own work, and have taken
 a baby from a soldier’s wife, when she
 had to work, and nursed it, or have
 gone for water for her, or have cleaned
 jan other man’s accoutrements, though
 it was no part of my duty to do sol
 When I have been engaged in politico,
 (literature and travelling for a newspa
 |pcr, I have not hesitated to travel
 many miles out of my road to ascertain
 a local fact, or to pursue a subject into
 (its minutest particulars, if it appeared
 that the public were unacquainted with
 the facts of the subject and this at
 time 3 when I had work to do which was
 much more pleasant and profitable.
 When I have needed employment, I
 have accepted it at whatever wages I
 could obtain—at plough, in farm drain,
 jin stone quarrv, at breaking stones foj
 roads, at wood-cutting, in a sav'-pit, as
 a civilian, or as a soldier. 1 have in
 London cleaned out a stable and
 j groomed a cabman’s horse fora six
 pence, and been thankful to the cabman
 for the sixpence. I have subsequently
 fried literature, and have done as much
 writing for ten shillings as I have readi
 ly obtained—been sought after and
 offered—ten guineas for. But had I
 not been content to begin at the begin
 ning, and accepted shillings, I would
 not have risen to guineas. I have lost

 Jenny Lind in Hull. —lt being
 proposed to erect a church in Hull,
 w here the worship is to be conducted
 in the German tongue, a letter was ad
 dressed to Mdlle Lind, who is a Lu
 theran, soliciting a contribution. This
 was directed to her in London, but it
 appears that on its arrival there she had
 left, and it was forwarded to her in
 Manchester. No answer being receiv
 ed, it was thought that the matter bad
 ended. On Thursday morning se’n
 niglit, however, Mr. Helmsing, who
 bad written the letter, heard a rap at
 his door, and there stepped in a very
 modest-looking young lady, who asked
 tor Mr. Helmsing. “My name is
 Helinsing,” was the reply; and mine
 is Jenny Lind,” was the response. “I
 have come to apologise for not answer
 ing your letter, which followed me to
 Manchester, where I had not time to
 attend to it; but I shall be most happy
 to promote your object, and if to-rnorn
 ing you w ill send to my hotel a list of
 subscriptions, I will tell you what I will
 do.” On the following morning Mr.
 Helmsing waited on Jenny Lind, who
 at once presented to him XJtl for the
 object proposed.
 The Hum anizing Influence of
 Cleanliness.—A neat, clean, fresh
 aired, sweet, cheerful, well-arranged,
 and well-suited house, exercises a
 moral as well as a physical influence
 over its inmates, and makes the inebv
 bers at a family peaceable and consid
 erate of the feelings and happiness of
 each other; the connection is obvious
 bet w een the state of mind thus produc
 ed and habits of respect for others and
 tor th tse higher duties aud obligation*
 w hich no law can enforce. On tie con
 trary, a filthy, squalid, noxious dwel
 ling, rendered still more wretched by
 its noisome site, and in which none of
 the decencies of life can be observed,
 contributes to make its unfortunate in
 habitants selfish, sensual and regardless
 ot the feelings of each other; the con
 stant indulgence of such passions rea
 ders thorn reckless and brutal, and the
 transition is natural to propensities and
 habits inconipatib.e with a respect for
 the property of others or for the laws.

NORTHAMPTON WATER CURE.
 Electricity ami Hydropathy.
 THE pul lie arc resect tfully informed, that since
 the philosophical deduction* of the learned I&gt;r.
 Means, of Emorv "College, Ga., and the*scientific
 experiments of Mr. Hemmer of England,* have
 recently and indubitably ertalrlislted tlie fart, that
 the conclusions at which the undersigned arrived l&gt;v
 the sense of touch, in 1844, are iu harmony with
 natural and physiological laws—to wit, that the
 human body, m a healthy condition, is in a /«w:drc
 electrical state, and that the electrical emanation?
 from the articular Surface, indicate health, or the
 symptoms and character of disease—there is sonic
 reason to hojie, that certain physicians, ignorant of
 these principles or natural laws, a knowledge ot
 which is essential to the safe and intelligent practice
 of the healing art, will cease their vociferations
 against the positive electrical state of the
 hiimnn body, and will hesitate to dissuade those
 whom they have failed to relieve of their complaints,
 from seeking nature's remedy at the Northamp
 ton Water Cure. Thus sustained by the light
 of science, the undersigned may Is; permitted here
 i to rejeat his expel ience, that, in all cases where the
 wrist, stomach, or luni&gt;s, are in tlte electro-negative
 Condition, the patient is la-yond the power of water
 to a lion I relict. On the other hand-, w hen the parts
 of the body alluded to, are iu tlie electro-positive
 state, however disarranged, there is ground to hope
 for a cure.
 Had not the results of past years’ practice
 already convinced the public of the safety or ti title
 fulness of tlie principles by w hich the undersigned i:
 i governed, in detecting the symptoms and charaete
 of disease, and practising tlie cure, the recent scien
 tific demonstration of their correctness, by I’rofesso
 Meai is and Mr. Hemmer, could not tail to conviuci
 the most incredulous.
 Gratefully the credit so gencroush
 awarded for bis success as a Hydropathic I’raeti
 j turner, by a discerning public, ami tlie gratitude
 evinced by those whom he has had the j Icasim-h
 j relieve of their complaints, the undersigned w!l
 j assiduously endeavor to sustain the credit,and men
 j that gratitude, in the ease of every invalid who mat
 afford him an opportunity to ofiect a cure, li\ hi;
 original and philosophical method of practice.
 The N’oithamj ton M ater Chic is pleasantly situ
 ated near Ben.'onvillc, on tl:«‘ west bank of lackiut;
 Water, or Mill River, about two and a lialf
 •from the centre of tlie town. It is conveniently

 a variety of baths, supplied w ith water, which, fin
 abundance, purify, and adaptodness to wa*er-nin
 pan poses, is unsurpassed by that of any o(bur esta
 blishment in this country. The scenery in tiiis
 vicinity is picture srpie arid romantic There ate a
 variety ot pleasant walks, sufficiently retired, to
 allow water-cure patients to apjiear sis‘they should,

 Terms for treatment and board are 50 to
 $8 50 per week, payable weekly—washing extra.
 A patient who from choice or the character of his
 complaint, occupies a room alone on tlie third floor
 will pay £8 00 per week—on the tirst and second’
 floors, S s*l per wick. I’atieuf* rcipiiiing extra
