 To the exclusion of ®everal commuoica
 and othsr nutter* of considerable inter
 est. we give our reader* a condensed accm...
 oi she recent tragical event* in Pari*. Tin
 in tropols* of France ba* been the see e o
 horrors which it was hoped would never agau
 be enacted ia the civilised world. Say* th&lt;
 London Time*, The massacre of St. Bar
 tholomew in 1572, the commotions w hich tool
 place during the revolutionary period, from
 l7dt to 17U5 —the ten day* of 1830—have
 all been surpassed by the present insurrection
 in horrible brutality and carnage.”
 That the insurgents wete under the direc
 tion of some head j»os®ocd of power r ‘d in
 telligence, doea not admit of a doubt. Some
 mention the name of Henry 1., some tlie
 adherents of Louis Philippe, some hint at
 England—this, of coutue, utterly without
 foundation.
 Says the Tribune It scarcely ventur
 ing too far, to suppose that the agency of
 Russia may have partly aided to sustain them.
 That Jesuit of the nation* has had her f-harc
 in the bloodshed of Prague she now threat
 ens Prussia; and hopes, by placing herself
 at the head of' tbs Sclavonic movement, to
 become the controlling power of Europe.—
 The unaccountable abundance of Russian
 gold in Paris just before the revolt, may be
 explained on this supposition. But the worst
 foes of France dwell within her own borders,
 and if she should fall it will by Jier ow n
 children’s hands.”
 Money and want, appear to have been the
 moving springs of action. Many of the
 prisoners, when captured, had considerable
 sums of money on their persons, and several,
 when asked why they fought, replied, lo
 earn the money that has been g.vcn us.
 Others replied, Better die from a musket
 ball than from hunger.”
 Some of the English press, says the Bos
 ton Bee, look upon this insurrection as a com
 plete overthrow of the Monarchical and ultra
 democratic parties of the State. Perhaj*s it
 is so. But until it is known t cho in the Na
 tional Assembly favored this outbreak, and
 ujKin what individuals in the government re
 liance can be placed, it is unwise to pronounce
 a decided opinion.
 The Beginning.—Pursuant to the dcier
 mination to diminish the number of our nets,
 fthe Government directed that a dtaught ol
 I3(XW of them, inhabitants of the provinces,
 should leave town on the 22d. They were
 ••applied with money, and orders for board
 iug and lodging. They left town, but halted
 outside the barriers, and there spent a large
 .share of their expenses. About 3 o’clock, a
 body, amounting to 400, returned, and paid a
 -visit to the Executive Government. M. Marie
 resell ted himself to hear their grievances.—

 refused to hear him, as he had been amongst

 Preparations of the Insurgents.—An
 eye-witness, who strongly condemns the ap
 parent apathy of the bourgeoise in the outset
 6f the insurrection, gives a narrative of his
 own observation on the morning of the 23d.
 After stating that the Porte St. Denis was the
 focus of all the disorder, he says that on ap
 proaching that neighborhood he was surprised
 not to see a single soldier, or National Guard,
 but, on the other hand, several thousands of
 the conspirators in possession of the whole of
 ihe district, and already entrenched in bat Ti
 rades of the most formidable description.—
 Across the boulevards was an immense bar
 ticade, formed of four or five omnibuses, sev
 eral carriages, a huge wagon, and paving
 stones taken from the streets, torn up for a
 Considerable distance on both sides.
 A little beyond the Hue St. Denis was an
 other, fully as formidable, and composed of
 miscellaneous materials; and still further on
 toward the Porte St, Martin wa* a third, not
 so large as the first, hut still sufficient to be a
 powerful defence, The end of the Rue du
 Faubourg St, Deni* was also closed up with a
 hug barricade, which prevented the approach
 of troops from the outskirts. The Rue St,
 Denis, the Rue Villeneuvc Bourbon, the Rue
 de Clery, and the other streets abuting on the
 spot in possession of the insurgents were
 similarly defended, and thousands of gamins
 were industriously working with pikes aud
 spades, tearing up the streets and adding to
 the defences.
 The mere enumeration of these extensive
 woiks, shows how much tune must have been
 •pent in their erection, and it is wonderful to
 think the authorities, who had been fonvarned
 of what was doing, and who show so much
 alacrity in calling out the troop® when there is
 no occasion for them, should have allowed
 them to be completed without interruption,
 The barricades were defended by tome
 hundreds of people in blouses, of whom many
 were not armed, or at least did riot show ifieir
 arms. They had a great number of tri-colored
 flag* stuck upon the lop of the barricades,
 with the words ateliers nationauj" inscribed
 upon them. The Porte St. Denis, which
 was in the hand* of the conspirators, was de
 corated with the black flag, and on the lop of
 it were arranged heaps of* paving stone*, ap
 parently for the purpose of being hulled upon
 the heads of those who might attack it.
 oil l:k8T On U»® morning of
 the 23d, about 4 o’clock, about 5,000 men
 •reeled barricades at the Ports St. Dennis and
 Martin. Many of them were armed with
 muskets. At about ton they attacked a post
 of National Guards, u d attempted to disarm

 Cople fled. At about 3 o’clock, the rappel

Dcsteration c t the Pore lace.—A* a
 proof of the forbearance ef the troops,and tin
 desperate reckle*foca® of th® populace, wc
 i give a brief dearoptton of an attack made by
 a j a rge bauailhm of the National Guards on a
 barricade in the Porte Bt. Denis:
 On the appearance of thia battalion the in
 surgenta, taking it for a regiment of the lute,
 and hoping to shake the fidelity tif the regular
 troop®, raised a about of Vive te Ltgrn
 but on finding their mtstske mmt of them
 1 fled. There remained only seven men and
 two women, who fought desperately. One
 of the men, who held a flag in km hand, was
 j ti,® first to fife; hi* companion* followed hts
 example, and the National Guards returned
 the fire. The man who carried the flag fell
 j dead. One of the females, a young w oman,
 neatly dressed, picked up the flag, and
 leaping over the barricade, rushed toward
 the National Guard*, uttering language ot
 provocation.
 Although the fire continued from the barri
 cade, the National Guards, fearing to injure
 this female, humanely abstained for some time
 from returning it, and exhorted bei to with
 draw. Their exhortations, however, were
 vain, and at length self-preservation compelled
 them to fire, aod she was killed. The other
 female then advanced, took the flag, and be
 gan to throw atones at the National Guards.
 The fire from the barricade bad become fee
 ble, but several shots wore fired from the
 sides and fW»m the windows of Imuaes, and
 the National Guards, in returning the fire,
 killed the second female.
 At last or.lv one man regained at the barri
 cade, but he kcpt'tfp d constant discharge.—
 One of* the National Guards left tire ranks,
 sword in hand, and rushing to the liarricade,
 turned aside the musket of this man just as he
 w as about to fire again, and took him prisoner.
 The capture of tins barricade did not put an
 end to the combat. A galling fire was poured
 upon the National Guards from the window®
 of the houses of which they had taken forcible
 [&gt;ossossion. The number of killed on this
 point is estimated at about twenty on both
 &gt;idcs. The number of wounded was also
 considerable.
 Lamartine, Aeago, and others. —During
 the day’s combating, the roemliers of the Ex
 ecutive Committee exposed themselves boldly.
 At many barricade.- Arago presented himself,
 and reasoned, or attempted to reason,with the
 people. His friends frequently feared that he
 I would be killed, but the rabble seemed to re
 spect his courage—courage, we may remark,
 of the very noblest character, as he exposed
 his own life in the hope of preventing blood
 shed. In some instances he was loudly
 1 cheered.
 During the greater part of the day Lamar
 tine accompanied (Jen. Cavaignac to the
 scenes of contest, the General having been
 slightly wounded. Pierre Bonaparte had his
 j horse wounded by the side of Lamartine. M.
 Bixio, who in the National Assembly pro
 i posed that the members should take part w ith
 the National Guard, was shot, it is feared
 mortally. Clement Thomas was wounded i;i
 the thigh. Domes, a Representative, and
 one of the Editors of the National, was also
 wounded.
 The Fighting on Friday.—ln the course
 of the morning 0110 men of the Garde Mobile
 were disarmed by a body of the insurgents,
 headed by an individual in the uniform of an
 officer of the National Guaid. At 6 o’clock
 ilie fighting continued, and the number of
 troops had been increased. Fifteen National
 Guards were killed at the Porte St. Denis.—
 By a fatal mistake, two legions of the National
 Guards fired on each other. The erics among
 the populace were various—“ Vive Ilenri
 V. ive Napoleon!” Vive la ltepub
 lique!” were severally heard. A member of
 the Assembly raised a flag at the Porte St.
 Denis, bearing the inscription, Du pain, on
 la mort.” (Bread or death.) M. Caussi
 diere at this hour joined the mom here of the
 Executive Guvtrmiient *a Itursebaci.amdttew
 passed along the Boulevaids. The insurgents
 occupied a house in the Faubourg St. Denis,
 from which they fired on the troops. Two
 hundred prisoners were taken by the National
 Guard on the Place de la Sorhonne.
 At nine o'clock, the struggle in the quarter
 of St. Jacques was most terrible. The in
 surgents, strongly barricaded, fired warmly on
 the National Guard and troops of the line,
 who replied. Cannon were at work. The
 Staff wore at the Hotel de Yille. The artil
 lery was on the Pont Notre Dame. The can
 non fired from this point on the Rue de la
 'Cite, and the bottom ol' the Rue St. J .cquez,
 appeared to engage them very much. Strong
 barricades existed in the Rue de la llarpe.—
 Much blood was shed, and Gen. Francois waa
 wounded. In the course of the evening the
 insurgents captured a post of Garde Mobile,
 aud made them march with them. All round
 the temple the town was in postession of the
 insurgents, who were defending themselves
 1 with intense energy. The platoon discharges
 replied to them every 5 minutes.
 it w as estimated that not less than 150,000
 i of the oufriers and the dregs of the popula
 tion of Paris and the Banlieu, were gathered
 together in the deperatc attempt to make an
 other revolution, and recover the mastery.
 Such was the nature of the work on
 Thursday and Friday, It is fearful to con
 template the bloody scenes of these tw o days,
 and of Saturday, Sunday, and the morning of
 Monday. What was enacted in those two
 days, was repeated, with more or less accom
 paniments of horror, to the end of the con
 flict;
 The insurgents shouted, “Down with the
 National Assembly—with Lamartine—with
 Jjcdru Kullin—with Marie! Ling live the
 Republic democratic and social! These
 were the chief cries, but othets exclaimed,
 Vive Napoleon and that pretty numer
 ously. Others again, but few and faint,
 Vive Henri Cinq but these were mere
 party cries.
 The Parisian mob—which is far too com
 monly confounded with the French pc/yple
 poured forth (earful cues of “bread or death!”
 Then was shouted, Death to Jjamartine!
 and to the other leaders once so popnlar, In
 fact, the names of the parties tfius denounced
 could only be distinguished by their being as.
 familiar a* household words, borne, however,
 could not be distinguished, and the most fear
 ful ciy of all was, Death to Death
 to the name being lost in the roar
 of the crowd or the noise of the musketry.
 A Correspondent of the London Times thus
 describes the principal scene of struggle
 When those who have been at Waterloo

 ihe city of Part® was as profusely furnished
 with loophole® a® was the garden wall ot

 were protected by bouses adjoining to or com
 manding them, sod that, as occasion presented
 itself throughout Saturday and Sunday, a;
 constant, unerring and deadly fire was'kept
 up on the ascatfonia by an almost invisible;
 garrison, they will not be surprised at the pro-t
 longed resistance, nor at the immense h«® ofi

 led astray, and several had money tn th.;ir
 pockets, and excited the other* to fiaht by *ll
 kinds of evil reports. Many of them were
 poor workmen, driven to despair by that mis
 ery which they had endured for four mouths,
 and who replied to tht«e who asked them
 what they were fighting for, It is better toj
 be killed with a bullet than to staive to
 death!” None of them, when drink was
 presented to them, would accept wine with
 out water; and one of them, having killed a
 Mobile, who had wnunoed his hand, began to
 cry hkf a child. Some of ihe leader* were
 constantly endeavoring to excite them by dis
 tributing to them strong liquors, and repeating
 to them the most odious stories. At one time
 they said the 11th Legion had massacred a
 great number of them; at another, that 600
 woikinen iiad been sent from the Ateliers Aa-i
 iionuux to go and work at Footainbleau, and
 that they had been received on their arrival'
 by the Maire, who told them they wo.ild not;
 employ such canaille. M. Payer remarked'
 that the leaders never exposed themselves, and I
 disappeared at the least danger.
 Closing Battle.—-The latest collision be
 tween the military and the insurgents took)
 place at Belleville, and was thus described bv
 General Lcbreton, who commanded, to his,
 colleagues of the National Assembly, where 1
 he arrived just after the termination of the 1
 evening’s sitting oa Tuesday. It is reported
 in the CorrslrtutioTlnel of Wednesday, and he!
 says he heard the General make the recital j
 “A last barricade,” said the General, re-1
 mained at Belleville. I caused it to he r.;con- i
 noitred by the National Guard of the place, t
 and by the National Guard of Rouen and that 1
 of Amiens. 1 then sent for the Mayor. 1
 asked him if he could not find some one to!
 open a communication with the insurgents.—
 Tiie mayor replied in the affirmative, and 1
 shortly afterwards he brought to me a citizen,
 who went to the barricade, and returned with,
 four of the combatants. They approached!
 and saluted me. Addressing myself to one I
 of them. Tasked what they desired. lie re-1
 plied, General, we wish they shouldguaran-1
 lee to us our rights." 1 do not understand
 such language,’ replied the General, ‘and you
 deserve that I should order you to be shot on
 the spot, but you are here ou my word, and I
 shall do nothing of the sort. Return, a.id :f
 in a quarter of an hour you have not lain
 down vour arms, 1 will Lave yon all shot.’ ”j
 The General gave orders for the occupation
 of all the houses the window set' which looked
 into the barricade. The assailants were im-j
 patient to finish the matter, and at the end of
 five minutes they commenced a murderous
 fire, which the besieged returned; but a few
 moments afterwards they surrendered, fiuding
 that all resistance was usAess, and that morel
 than a fifth of their number had been cither
 killed or wounded. The others, .to the nu.ii-!
 her of eighty, were taken prisoneis uudoritfiej
 protection of ihe General, who had lira great
 est difficulty*in sarinfi them Trom the ven-'
 gerjnee of his troops.
 The Killed and Wounded.— Various
 are ihe computations, ranging from 10,000 to
 16,000, as to those who have fallen; the nurn-,
 h *r of wounded it is not even attempted to es
 timate. The massacre of St. Bartholomew,
 it is said, was less destructive as regards the;
 sacrifice of life, and even, some say, the bat
 tle of Waterloo. Among the more remarka
 ble persons killed are the Archbishop of Paris'
 and General Brea, the Commandant of the j
 Garrison of Nantes, who was shot under the!
 moxt lamentable circumstances. One of the!
 insurgents having been captured by some of}
 the Garde Mobile, these men, infuriated at
 their inhuman conduct, determined to shoot
 him, when, at the moment of execution,
 General Brea thew himself before the prison
 er, and entreated them i&gt;y all the laws of war
 ns well as humanity to spare lorn, and leave
 him to the hands of justice. This noble Ap
 peal had scarcely passed his lips, when the
 1 uffianly captive,who stood behind him, pulled
 out a pistol" and shot the general dead. The
 murderer was immediately put to death amidst!
 yells of fury. Col. Charbouuel was wounded, 1
 and died in forty-eight hours. General Re
 nault w as also wounded, but it is hoped that j
 he will recover. Gen. Negtier, one of the!
 queslors of the National Assembly, has lost
 his life. He headed the foree which on Sun
 day evening drove the insurgents ftonu the!
 corn stores of the barrack of the Ceiestins,
 where they had taken refuge; then returning
 by the Boulevard Boudan, he sent Command-'
 ant Boizard of the National Guard to order
 reinfoicements, in order to rescue the upper
 part of the Hue St. Antoine from the insifr
 gents, who were still in the neighborhood of
 the church of St. Paul, when he was struck
 by a ball, at the entrance of the Rue St. 1
 Antoine, in front of the great barricade which'
 defended the entrance of the faubourg.
 Laroque, the editor of the Pm- Duchcsnr
 and chairman of a furiously revolutionary
 club. La Montagne, was shot at the Barrier'e’

 of the chief instigators of the insurrection,!

 says: t* The number ot prisoner® already

 Advi«*®, dated from Paris on Wednesday,
 state that the appearance of Pam was suit
 very melancholy. Flwa the *a»t number of
 casualties in the course of the four day®
 during which the insurrection lasted, almost
 every one has lost father, husband, brothers,
 or friends. Ia every, street women appeared
 in deep mourning, with.all the signs of deep
 affliction. Vast numbers of the National
 Guards’were missing, aiid the doubt as to their
 fate is almost m« ra painfui thau-the certainty
 oT the w6fst. Id church fhneral serv
 ices were going on from mdtwing till night,
 and the same sorrowful eymptc maof the evils
 of civil war must necessarily continue unaba
 ted for several days. The number of the
 dead and wmmdt dW be still seen carried
 along the different streets was extraordinary.
 All the women,from the highest to the lowest,
 were busy preparing lint for the hospitals.
 A correspondent of the Boston Chronotype
 says.
 I have seen Paris in a more desperate crisis
 than perhaps it ever passed through before.
 The times of Robespierre were prolific n|
 horrors, but I doubt whether they ever pro
 duced anything as honible as the last week
 has done. Then in one day hundreds were
 shin by the guillotine, now in four days,
 Friday and Saturday of last week and Sun
 day and Monday of tins, thousands have
 fallen then it ttas political fanaticism that
 sent men to death, now it has been the fanat
 icism of the pocket.”
 Well, now it is over,md Gan.Cavaignac is
 the hero of the day. He has certainly acted
 like a skilful general aftd a man of heart. 1
 seu in Paris,” he says in hh proclamlion
 announcing the victory, the vanquishers and
 the vanquished; accursed lie my name if
 I consent to see aay victims.” In the Cham
 ber the other day urging the n3cessity of a
 humane disposition of the prisoner;—of whom
 there nr n-.t less than 8000—he said: Let
 us ru t f i that we arc making history,
 and 1! at suab a time can never be ef
 faced. H will rule for a time at least, and
 it is pruno-vd that the Assembly shall appoint
 him President of the Republic for 10 months
 to co ne. Possibly this may be done but that
 will not confirm him in power. The intrigues
 of the nionarclii,dists who are laboring to
 bring in Thiers, and who propagate the most
 abominable calumnies against ail prominent
 men, tiie machinations of other fictions, the
 restlessness of the whole public mind and
 this yet unsettled labor question, all make it
 doubtful. He is however a republicmi and a
 man of energy, and possibly may prove able
 to hold his position.
 Lamartine's day has gone by. Hois now
 hardly spoken of and has no influence.”
 G.'n. Cavaignac was entrusted with sup
 reme power oq Friday: On Wednesday he
 snrrended it/whereupon fhe Assembly passeT
 him a vote of thanks by accla nation. The
 Ministers then tendered their resignations,
 which were accepted; and a decree was
 passed confiding to General Cavaignac the
 Executive power, with the title of President,
 of the Council, and with power to appoint
 his own Ministers. It was arranged that the 1
 funeral of the victims should lake place on
 Friday.

 Address of Anti-Slavery Woolen of West
 ern New York,
 Under a deep arid a biff ng^mprraof the
 duty we owe to God and o'er fellow beings,
 .the Anti-Slavery women of Rochester feel
 constrained to continue to persevere in their
 efforts for the oppressed and suffering bond
 men who still remain toiling unrequited in the
 Southern prison house. We a*e frequently
 brought painfully to remember that no*, only
 is their labor wrested from them unr*munera
 ted not only do thoy suffer from intense hun
 ger and cold not only are the females, ora
 sisters, subjected to the cruol aad passionate
 outrages of their tyrannical masters and over
 seers ..t there are daily instances of sun
 dering the dearest ties in nature, thus sepa
 rating them forever. And can we exjiect any
 thing better—can we look for benevolence or
 fins feelings from a system so foul and fiend
 ish as slavery It would be unreasanabje,
 because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
 good fruit.*’ Therefore, knowing that with
 out associative action we cannot render effi
 cient aid to this holy cause, we affectionately
 invite the co-operation of the citizens of Roch
 ester and the public generally. We ask them
 to bear in mind the injunctions of Jesus, “All
 things whatsoever ye would men should do to
 you, do ye even so to them.” Remember,
 also, the beautiful parable in which he calls
 our attention to the sick and to those who are
 in prison, and concludes by the forcible asser- i
 tion, “Inasmuch as ye have done it tooneufthe
 least of these, my brethren, ye have done it J
 unto me.” We feel assured all that have
 hearts to feel, and arc careful to attend to the
 monitions of conscience—all who are deter
 mined to live for the good of our race, instead
 of devoting all their time to their own per
 sonal case—all w ho feel bound to improve the
 precious time allotted to them here, by pro
 moting as much as jiossihlo the cause of truth
 and righteousness in the earth, will come for
 ward in the work of laboring to banish forever
 the diinon of slavery from our land and in j
 so doing, instead of an example of corruption
 and wickedness, we should be a light to the
 world.”
 We hope no o*lo will feel too poor, nor any
 too rich, to enlist in this holy cause. The
 Christian's influence, in whatever situation, is
 always salutary, and will certainly produce its
 good effects. We ask for the aid of men and
 of wumen;—-we call on the old and the I
 young, the firmer,, the jnechaaic, and the
 merchant. "We ask all and every one to give
 us their help to devote what they can spare,
 cither of money or of the fruits of tneir la
 bor, to the work of restoring men and women
 to themselves, to their manhood, to the rights
 and blessings with which they were endowed
 by our Creator.
 For this object, vre propose holding a Fair
 in December next. We ask the females in
 the adjoining towns and country around us, to
 get up sewing circles, and prepare such arti- 1
 cles as will be most saleable, and to come, fur- 1
 nish tables, give us their company, and help j
 us, not only in selling those tilings thus pre
 pared, but in convincing the public mind of
 the necessity of our perseverauoo ami fidelity,
 and thus be helpers in hastening the day of!
 emancipation.

 rows of teeth, 3 before, an I 4 b-hin l; a tonga
 completes tlie wtole, which is firmly attach oil to tit*-
 frame, and serves to guide an I steady it when in

 manner,
 Tto advantages of this Cultivator are manifold.
 Ist, By means of the wh-tels the machine runs easy,
 and the teeth go to a uniform depth. 2 f. The teeth
 are so long, that the machine never rliokes, tto
