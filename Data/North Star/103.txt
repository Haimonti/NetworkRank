 Who is my Neighbor.
 Tins is a question that has been asked
 through th*’ world s history. All the systems
 of governments that have been framed in
 former times, have stummed over this
 stumbling bbick into the vortex of ruin, ihe
 question men asked in ibe.r imagined pros
 perity, they have found answered in il.c.r
 adversity. Monarchies, states, and republics
 have risen, fallen, and faded; and whyl—
 Because they were not founded on the great
 principle of the inalienable rights of ai.j. men.
 Thus men forget that however they might
 frame governments and laws for th* iiifi Ives,
 resting for support on enslaved millions, they
 themselves were subject to a higher, a divine
 government, whose decrees ar&lt;‘ immutable.
 Patriotism had indeed clung with ardor to liei
 institutions, as if immortal but experience
 has taught the world that i.u government can
 stand, while millions in slavery, like the Is
 raelite* in Egypt, an- calling unto God, day
 and night for deliverance.
 All Europe is at this moment receiving
 practical lessons on this point. She is begin
 ning to learn who arc her neighbors,

 Tlu ki.ig is g-tting acquainted with his
 subject, the lord wiiil b:s vassal, and
 fhe master with Lis s&lt; mint. The rumds of
 all men seem to be in commotion, like a
 mighty earthquake. (Jmj iiimsell seems to
 say, 1 will gather the nations, and assemble
 the kingdoms, to pour uj on them mine ind-g
 -nalions, even all my fierce anger.'’ '1 hus
 how apparent does the truth become, that the
 wrath of men shall praise God. Ihe his
 tory of man is a continued comment t it.
 Criminal on and reeriu nation, las followed
 from age to age among the nations, and a]j
 of them have found it hard to kirk against
 the pricks. M And can even this enlightened
 Republic of the nineteenth century, escape
 the punishment consequent upon slavery—upon
 invasive war? I answer, No; for “he that
 leadeth into captivity, shall go into captivity
 he that killath with the sword, must be killed
 with the sword.”
 Such, O America, are the admonitions o

 Deak Dot:class. —DoubtLssyou and some
 of your readers, will be pleased to learn that
 y e have achieved a glorious victory in the old

 merely state that about a year ago, two blood

 prey, lint they had learned was in Pennsyl
 vania. They made a visit to Carlisle w here
 they found a man at.d two women whom they
 claimed as theirs ihey arrested them in de
 fiance of our laws that kidnappers should bu

 men, noble-minded men, that would or could
 not stand and see their brothers or sisters car
 ried into interminable bondage by Christian
 Americans, who nob’y stood fonh mcVfer.ec
 of their rights as freemen, ar.d succeeded in
 recapturing the it dividends Irom the
 grasp of illu cradle rubber and set them at
 liberty; and during the melee, the slaveholder
 was very badly injured and died lu a few
 weeks—consequently a great many persons
 were arrested and thrown into prison; after a
 final ufa trial, Judge Uepburne sentenced
 .eleven men to the Eastern Benin nuary for
 three* years each committees were formed
 throngliout the State, and money was raised
 to test the legality of the sentence, and after
 a lapse of nine months or more, these eleven
 men were discharged by the Supreme Court,
 on the ground of illegal sentence. So the
 1 slaveholders and their abettors have been de
 feated once in Pennsylvania, which I think
 will bj a wanting in futute; these men have
 gone home with instructions from Philadel

 Chicago, Feb. 4lh, 1848,
 Friend I’ovclass, I embrsco a few
 minutes of leisure lime, to put you in posses
 sion of a few fads in rein non to the colored
 people of ibis city, which may not be unin
 teresting to your readers.
 We have here a debuting society, which is
 admirably calculated to bring out the talents
 of our young men. The subjects discussed
 i are of a miscellaneous nature.
 1 he number of colored inhabitants in this
 city i? small—there b- ing only about 250.
 A circumstance occurred in this city a few
 days ago. which caused considerable excite
 ment. A colored man, who was thought to
 be a t*py, was taken into custody. An ex
 amination took place, tile result of which was
 a severe fugging. In consequence of this, a
 law-suit is expected, of which, if it docs take
 ‘place, I will inform you in due season.
 In my next, 1 will give you an account of
 the proceedings at a public met ting held in
 this city by the colored citizen*, in relation to
 the merits of the colonization scheme, as a
 means of ameliorating the condition of the
 free colored people ct the I ailed States.
 Yours for the slate, J. J.
 The Slave’* Fute.
 Perhaps one cause of the comparative
 apathy of the bulk of the people of England
 with regard to the fate of their enslaved
 brethern in distant lands, may bo their utter
 inability to form a just estimate of their
 condition. The Englishman has so long re-
 I juiced in the blessings of personal freedom,
 has so long joyfully and exultlngly declared
 that no Siave could tread hu, native soil or
 breathe hi* native air, that L: is only tuo
 apt to be unmindful of those w Uose lot i» the
 i r
 exact opposite of hut ow n and secure in his
 own immunity, has not sufficiently remem
 bered those who are -till in bonds, an bound
 with them. The oft told tale has been so
 often repeated to him that there are thou

 -nu«-t acetn that the eouad whioh most at first
 have fallen npon his ear like a funeral knell,
 had now lost it* feat fa! meaning or rose to
 l ifly unheeded amidst the mingled voic s of
 jlea«ure and pain which reach him from the
 depths of the troubled bilious of Life. Ilut
 these things so to be Ab. surely not,
 Kather rhould we endeavour to bring before

 [asses oi, tb’ true euadilHst of the slaves
 ralher should w? endeavour to grasp, if pos
 sible, the mealing of this awful word—Slav
 ery. in all its fijarful actuality.
 We should take our places in thoaght
 at the side of the man who is torn by
 bloody hands from the enjoyments of his
 peaceful home —we should follow him to the
 crowded and loathsome bosom of the
 slave ship, #*o him exposed on the auction,
 block, renumbering ever that he is a man and
 far more a man than tho monsters who placed
 him there: we should watch him as he beholds
 the tenderst ties of love and friendship
 brok 'n and trampled on go with him to the
 burning plains of unrewarded and unsweet
 ened toil see him in chains and under the
 lash —and then go again through all these
 abysses of human misery aul degradation,
 and see in each fearful picture, instead ol
 the manly, a female form and if by that time
 the custom-hardened heart is not softened, let
 it turn to those street voorg buds of
 tality which gladden the fields of life in
 lands of freedi rn and happiness, and hear the
 wail of infantine woe, the anguished cry of
 childhood 100 early tutored in experiences
 which the philosophy of ripyr years has not yet t
 learned lo bear unshrinking!v. And these arc
 but a few of the forms of suffering under
 which Slavery presents itself before us.
 In order more fully to appreciate th;
 depths of its sinfulness, we must print, if
 we can, the midnight blackness which it brings
 upon the isoul=&gt;-the bleeps of ignorance in
 which it plunges its victims—the fearful
 descendings of that cloud of despair which
 crushes down the fresh and bursting aspira
 tions of the immoilal mind —the coldness
 of that w ave which quenches, or is meant to
 quench the w armest and holiest ailcctions of i
 the heart, and which does its best and kind
 liest work for the life at least, when indeed it
 turns the burning beating heart of man into a
 hard and stony mass. Such are a few of the
 features of that picture which we have to con
 template, if wc would ji'rily estimate the
 fate of the slave, the injustice of the enslaver,
 or our ow n duties wilh regard to both. Let
 ns rather be willing, painful us it is, to have
 this picture often before ns, than hr in d ugcr
 of forgetting them and in tho midst of our
 compassion irir th oppressed, let us mourn
 yet mere deeply for the oppressor, inasmuch
 as his is tli guilt, a.id theirs only the suf
 fering. 11. M l’.

 1 am not aware t what extent 4COO milesi
 of distance enables you on the other side of
 the Atlantic, to view the numerous events i
 that havesimtiltaianootisly taken plica on the
 continent of Europe, in anythi. g like a focus
 with us, from the first startling outburst of
 the French revolution, to the news which has 1
 arrived to-day, that our ambassador has been
 dismissed by the court of Spain, quickly fol
 lowed by the appearance of that ambassador,
 himself, incidents of the most extraordinary
 nature have followed one another with strange
 rapidity, and m the most direful confusion.
 Those occurrences which, more than three
 months since, would have occupied columns,
 nav, w hole sides of the Times, are dismissed
 with supreme nonehalence in half a dozen
 sentences and the m in who, on perusing
 his morning paper, and finding it stated
 therein, that there had been a fail of one per
 cent, m the slocks, would have frightened his
 family with astonished exclamations, now
 reads, with the utmost unconcern, accounts of
 armed mob intervention—of an engagement
 involving the h&gt;&amp;s of thousands—of the fright
 of an emperor or tho ruin of a dynasty.
 With the striking events of the last two
 months, your readers are of course already
 familiar, and I need not recapitulate them
 but I will endeavor to give you a slight review
 ut'the present state of Jvaropo. France ex
 tinguished a corrupt government in a few
 days, stood erect from anarchy bui in her
 attempts at reconstruction, she liu* not failed
 to endure tiiosa convulsive movements w hich
 aie incident on all revolutions, and which bear
 the same relation to the gradual development
 of institutions in more favored countries,
 which the galvanic plunges of a revitalized
 body do to the regular function? of ordinary
 existence. She lias, however, recently de
 feated a conspiracy of the utmost danger to
 peace and'order and the attituda her gov.
 eminent assumed on that occasion, although
 not so firm as it might have been, has yet in
 spired men with a greater conviction of her
 stability titan they have hnUeito entertained.
 She is, in the labor question, attempting im
 possibilities, trom which the ruin&lt;.us results
 ought by this time t.i t&gt;« well known.
 The question involved in Italian independ
 ence, is far less that of government than of
 race. I allude more especially to the revolt
 of the Lo:abarJo*4 euetian kingdom. The
 extinction of a foreign domination will pro
 bably uivolic a re-establishment of native
 rule, tu tho shape of monarchy, divested,
 however, of the oppressive character it has
 assumed in the hands of the Austrian. The
 threatened deposition of a Pope who hae
 volunteered each concessions to the spirit of
 the time?, because h? refused to plunge into
 war, was a step raoit ungeneftms arid utterly
 unworthy the cause of liberty with which it
 was associated. I was, you know, in Milan
 last aututtui, and by nu means pi wuie myself
 oa tho prophetic power* which induced no
 absolutely to predict a desperate revolt there
 in the course of a f-*w tmuitha. Eighteen
 thousand troop# in a city net cnataMuag nearly
 tw ice that number of male adult inhabitants,
 were mauffieient to keep down the fierce roa
 tempt of foreign rule which manifested itself

 the ordinaiy maxims of international war,
 the Danes are a very ill used people, is, I
 believe, the true or.e. To give you tlie
 details of the quarrel in anything like rea
 sonable limits, is out of the question; so I
 forbear. One country, amid all tfce vast up
 heaving of this mural earthquake, remains
 sternly unmoved. The Czar has assembled
 some vast masses of his colossal army on his
 frontier, but has made no movement of ag
 gression, lie is reported ‘to have indulged

 The want of funds, which some time since
 proved such a source of weakness to the

 In every war that may occur, he will be an
 agent at once prominent and powerful.
 To return onto more to the south (for I
 find that I have omitted the Peninsula,) the
 queen of Portugal is but maintained at all by
 the determined support of our government,
 evinced by the imposing altitude of its all
 powerful fleet. Spain has again been the
 the theatre of two attempted revolutions of
 military origin, which have been succ-Safi.il/

 strance, addressed to the Spanish govern
 ment, on their oppressively arbitrary system,
 previous to th outbreak of the first of these,
 Lord Palmerston has incurred (in niv opinion
 very unjustly.) great odium. For a supposed
 participation in the second, (bow truly as yet
 is not known.) our ambassador has been
 driven from Madrid. I find I must leave all

 London, May 31, 1848.
 L)ft.\ji Sir. —Pi ;ny lart letter, 1 mentioned
 that Mr. Mitclrbli, the editor of the i idled
 Irish.nan,” was undergoing histtial fi&gt;r lblony
 under the recently passed li Crown and Gov
 ernment Security iiii!.” Tho jury having
 returned a verdict of guilty,’’ li3 was sen
 tenced to fourteen years’ transportation, and
 was, next day, after a very affecting farewell
 interview with his wife and family, taken,
 under an escort of dragoons, on board a ship
 bound for Spike Island, near Cork, there to
 await the sailing of a convict vessel. 'llia
 scene in court at the passing of sentence,
 was most extraordinary. From all quarters
 of the court, people pressed forward to shake
 hands wiih him, smile threw bouquets of
 floweio, Barristers in their sober gowns and
 wigs, jumped over the table, in order to give
 a last expression to their sympathy with the
 prisoner; the judge who p issed sentence,
 hastily left the bench, but Tt turned in a few
 minutes, while the other who remained,
 could not conceal his emotion. Several per
 sons were taken into custody for these mani
 festations, which were considered a contempt
 of court; but were shortly after liberated.
 Mr. Holmes, Mr. Mitchell's counsel, who
 had defended hij&gt; client, merely on the prin
 ciple that tho English government in Ireland
 being an usurpation, it couid not be w rong to
 wage war, or to excite to w ar against it; aad
 then said, that every word he had uttered, as
 Mr. Mitchell's advocate, was the expression
 of his own deliberate conviction, for which he
 was individually responsible, a:.d that the
 Attorney General might pros cute him i! he
 chose. The judge iuimodiaudy called upon
 the court to proceed with otocr business.
 Feeling strongly, as i do, the bitter wrongs
 and oppressions uuder which Ireland has so
 long groaned, it is mq&gt;ossible for ino not in
 sympathize even with lfe’se whom a eimhar
 feeling has goaded on to madness or to crime.
 Without, thenfofo, defending Mr. Mitchell,
 whose grand aim lit all his writings, was to
 prepare Ireland for an armed revolt against
 the there can be no doubt that
 the JlnuGi gaxerirae* is tho £r-t and great
 criminal. £&gt;cvca Out of nine tuiliiofis of l«m
 Irish, are Ilonas Lothouc* yet not a single
 Roman Catholic was allowed to mt on Mr.
 Mitchell's j*rry. Every Irishman is either a
 Repealer or an Ami-repealer; the majority,
 it cannot be doubted, are Repealers; jet the
 government w wild not allow, and they avow
 it, a single Repealer to sit upon the jury so
 that Mr. Mitchell’s jury was composed
 entirely »f his enemies. The government
 could not find, if they had wished it, an
 ferent jury; they dared cut uy lum by one
 impartially *e!ected. This fact alone n&gt; suf

 America, is one shilling, including both in
 hud aud ocean carriage. Mr. Euiritt’s pro
 posal U, that there should be a charge of a
 penny for inland postage, and a peony fur
 cenn postage, so that it would require only
 six times the present number of letters to pay
 the same amount of postage. There seems
 t o reason to doubt, that the change could be
 mad- without any loss to our revenue and,
 as it would ho an incalculable benefit to all
 partita res-idor-t in either country, and having
 friends in the other, all person* orj your side
 of the Atlantic, having friends here, should
 urge upon them the duly of assisting^in the
 attainment of so great a boon.
 The recent outbreak in Naples appears to
 have been of a most serious description; at
 all events it vres made so by the brutal or
 much worse than brutal conduct of the King,
 who let loose the lazzironi on the respectable
 inhabitants of the town, a groat part of which
 was consequently burnt to ashes. The hor
 rid scenes which took place, have roused the
 indignation of ail Italy, and the King of
 Naples is everywhere denounced as a monster
 and a Bourbon, who has forfeited every claim
 to his throne, and to the toleration of society.
 Yotirs truly, 11, S. D,
 To the Ladies of Paris iFio recent 1 tj addressed
 a petition to the Fren h Cfyanber of Deputies
 on the subject of Slavery
 Dear Friends trul Sisters in the cans-? of the
 Slave. —It was with unfeigned satisfaction, 1
 that wo observed your recent efforts in the
 cause of oppressed humanity—the cause of
 ‘.lie slave in your own Colonies; and we rc-j
 juice that you have been emboldened thus to,
 stand forth, and become mouth and utterance
 for the dumb.”
 Your well timed and powerful appeal to the
 Chamber ef Deputies, on behalf of your de-i
 graded sisters, lias filled our hearts with sym
 pathy and with an earnest desire not only to:
 assure vou of this, but to encourage vou in the
 1 blessed work. It is one which will assuredly
 bring upon you, the blessings of many; and
 we would unite our prayers with yours, that
 the far richer blessing of God may rest upon
 von in your endeavors to promote it, and that
 i He nmy so touch the hearts of those who
 have the power not only to listen to, hut l'a*
 vorably to heed the request of your petition.—
 i Nevertheless, should this not b? accomplished
 1 »o soon as you desire, he not discouraged, hut
 1 with that perseverance and true dignity which
 a consciousness of the righteousness and jus
 tice of the cans? roast ever impart, go on
 ever trusting in the faithfulness of God, and in
 the strength which He atfbrjeth, till it shall
 he declared on tin pages of your statute book
 that within the dominion of Fraiioe no slave
 can live.
 We agree with you, that it is peculiarly
 the province of Women to plead for her en
 slaved sisters, and to exert her gentle, yet
 often powerful influence with fathers, hus
 bands, brothers, and whet ever else she feels
 it will be availing. Many of the women of
 Great Britain have trodden a similar pith be
 fore you—it was oft times a claik and drear j
 one but they felt—they knew, that, bumble
 as their efforts were, they were valued by
 those whose prominent position rendered them
 far more powerful advocates in the cause.—
 The struggle was painful and anxious, vet
 the reward came at last—the day arrived w
 freedom was proclaimed in all the British
 LUiqds of the west —the shackles full and
 eveiy -.iiuther could call her child her own.
 You are ill iroughly alive to the horrors and
 degradation of the system—into that we do
 nut, therefore, deem it niceasary minutely to
 enter, but we would gladly throw our mite of
 influence into the treasury, and hid you God
 speed in vour ('hristian labors—never doubt
 ing, hm faithfully wot king, and humbly
 trusting that the day will come, and may you
 be honored instruments in hastening it, when
 every bond save that oflovc shall be broken
 and the oppressed shall go free.

 Address of An ti-stnverr Wonts of We«t

 Ender a deep and abiding impassion of the
 duty wo mv to Grid and o;tr fofVrtr hHngs,
 the Autt-Slim-rf wurmyn of Hiwhc«er feel
 constrained* to oraitinno to perKavnn* ta thrai
 elloTts for the oppressed and suth'hasr hooB

 Southern prison housiv Wo an fnx}ueut!y
 brought pmnfully to remenf!&gt;er that not only
 ii therr labor w rested from them nnromun’’‘ti
 led V not only do they suffer from inters" hmv
 ger and o*dd; not only arc the ternul.-e. or»
 sisters, subjected to the cruel mid parsion itc
 outrages of-their tyrannical mush rs and over-
 S?urs but there are daily instances of sun
 daring the lies in nature, thus sepa
 rating thnm forever. And can we expect any
 thing better —can we look for booevoleftcc ot
 fin*?'feelings from a system so foul ard fiend
 ish as slavery* It would hoiumesouaWe,
 because a pornrpt tr»&gt; oenrot bring forth
 good leuit.*’ Therefore, kuov. mg uiat wult
 out associative action wa caauut roudor tbli
 eient aid to this holy cause, we aUuotiopatuly
 invite the co-operation of the citizens of Roch
 ester and the public generally. We anktlvmn
 to bear in mind the injunctions of Jesus,‘‘All
 things whatsoever ye would men should do tc
 you, do even so to them.” Remember,
 also, the beautiful parable in which lie calls
 our attention to the sick auJ to those who al
 in prison, and concludes by the forcible asser
 tion, “Inasmuch as yq have done it to one of the
 least of these, my brethren, ye have done ii
 unto me.” We fed assured a’l that have
 hearts to fed, turd are careful to attend to thr
 monitions of conscience—xll who are deter
 mined to iiva for the good of our race, instead
 of devoting all then time to tlpiir own per
 sonal ease-‘-ah wlta fuel bound ta improve the
 pro -hips tints allotted to them here, by pio
 umting as much as possible the cause of truth
 and righteousness in the earth, wilt come for
 ward in the work of laboring to banish forevei
 tbo demon of slavery from our land and'in
 so doing, instead of an example of corruption
 and wiokuiuesa, W 3 bin. fob be a light to tut
 world.”
 We hope no otio vyill feel too poor, nor any
 too rich, to enlist in this holy cause. The
 Christian's influence, in whatever situation, is
 always salutary, and wall certainly produce its
 good elficts. We ask for the aid of men and
 of women; —we call on the old and tiie
 young, the farmer, the mechanic, and the
 merchant. We ask all and every one to give
 us their help to devote what they can spare,
 either of money nr of the fruits of their la
 bor, to the work of restoring men ami women
 to themselves, to their manhood, to the rights
 and blessings with which they were endowed
 by our Creator.
 For this object, wo propose bolding a Fail
 in December uqxt. We ask the females ii
 the adjoining towns and country around us, ti
 get up sewing circles, and prepare such art!
 eles as will ho'most saleable, and to come, fur
 nish tables, give ns their company, and he!]
 us, not oidy tn selling those things thus pro
 pared, but in convincing the public mind
 the necessity of our perseverance aud fidelity
 and thus be helpers in fastening the day o
 emancipation.
