"T. HOPPER AND DAVID
 1 RIMMIkKfta yit
 While at Albany Hu* f«H* 1 enjoys! the
 MUh&amp;rtiun of taking by the hand that veae

 aion of benevolence. Hi* prrecne* at once
 iggreted a train of rrt«*c i mi relative to the
 undrrgrownd railroad, to which many
 American slave* hare owed their ftftoape
 from the prison house of the pceuliai institu-
 Uon.
 Friend Hopper is about seventy-six years
 of age, Imt pnwesse* mtieh of the activity
 and vivacity of healthy middle life. His
 eagle eye is not dimmed, tior hi* natural force
 abated. He wonderfully ru-einblea Napoleon
 Bonaparte. 'Lite high aquiline n&lt;ne, tlie fla
 ming eye, the atfawanlinr. marble forehead,
 the delicate firm mouth, the same undcr-siae
 aiul peculiar lorn, tho stooping shoulder*

 guished in statutes and busts of the Little
 (krrporal and he speaks like hirn,and moves
 like him; clear in conversation,v tthout repeti
 tion ot spaiv word, or hesitancy ol thought or
 spceeh. All he says is as trim amt fit for the
 press as hi* tales of oppression,’which he
 narrates from memory, and without any refer
 ence to record, except the record made on his
 vivid recollection hr the events themselves.
 The wonderful acuteness, without educa
 -"-tTor, as a lawyer, with w hich lie has uurav
 elkxl the most complicated stories, and foiled
 che utmost cunning of the slave-hunlers—by
 which hundreds of fugitives have been retain
 ed at the North—should commend him to our
 heartfelt gratitude; and w hen his work is
 done on this earth, and he retires to rest with
 his fathers, the tears of many a son and
 daughter, whose parents owe their liberty to
 his exertions, w ill plentifully bedew his grave.
 The collection of his Tales of Oppression”
 in a single volume, would form an excellent
 manual, which might tie consulted and aid in
 the assistance of other fugitives. The time
 will conic when they will he the storehouse of
 romantic incidents for the pen of the future
 novelist.
 In tins connection, there is no name so ap-,
 propria!e as David Buggies—a man who has]
 lieen instrumental in .securing the liberty of
 six hundred human beings from Southern sla
 very. On the Ist of August, 1841, the
 friends of freedom in Boston tendered him a
 soiree, in commemoration of these services.—
 It was a joyful occasion, for with this tribute
 wxs blended the anniversary of West India
 emancipation. The hour and the won were
 alike remembered. I look back w ith pleasure
 to the hearty response which was elicited by
 ft statement of the number aided by his efforts,
 iu reply to which lie remarked
 4 1 have had the pleasure of helping 000
 persons in their dight from Ixunls. !ii ihis 1
 hive tried to do my duty. Bv Jehovah’s
 help 1 have tried to do it, and mean to still
 Incan to persevere oil the last fitter shall he
 broken, and the last sigh beard from the lips
 &lt;W a slave. But give tin* piai.se So Him who
 sustains us all—w ho holds up the heart of the
 laborer in the rice-swamps, and cheers him,
 when by tli tw inkling of the north star lie
 find* Ins wav to Liberty. .Stielt men bring
 wnli them the strongest testimony to the
 value of fire *doni. Six hundred in three
 years I have caved had it lieen in one year,

 the duty of every American when he reflects
 ttrct it was fh blood of colored men as well
 a-* w hite*. wliiHi crimsoned ihe b iu!e-ficld.sof
 Hunker-Hid and the rest, in ihe struggle to
 sustain the principles emoodicd in our Djcla
 ln*o &lt;d’ Independence.”
 David Buggies, since then, has been sub
 jected to a rare combination of trials; but
 with a spirit inflexible to defeat, he has jwr
 •evered against olrstfteh’s vvtiieh woubl dis
 hearten the major purl of mankind. Though
 suffering from an almost total delect of vision,
 he ha* est ihlishcd a Water Cure Infirmary at
 Northampton, Mass., where, by his superior
 tort and tahnt, (his sense of touch being won
 derful!}' acute.) lie is sought for by invalids
 from every section of the country, who are
 daily testifying to bis successful treatment,
 May his future days be full of Junior. and the
 grateful confidence ef all classes his rich re
 ward —may the substantial comforts of hi*
 age Ik* a solid evidence how fully his early
 labors, and sacrifices have been appreciated by
 all who claim to l»c friends of man, irresjicet
 ivo of color ami clime.
 ilop|&gt;cr and Buggies have done their duty
 in colonizing men, women and children not
 from America to Liberia, but from •'Slavery to
 Freedom. To the shame of Republican
 America, lx; it proclaimed, that many of the«r
 jointed slaves could not be free until landed in
 .Canada, under the protection of Queen
 Victoria.
 Abolitionists are sometimes asked bow
 many slaves thrij lone emancipated. If the
 •comparison between their labors and those of
 the Colonization Society is wanted, it may no!
 .lie amiss to mention that since 18If» there have
 jmt been more than (5,(H)0 transported to
 Africa, while Anti-Slavery has forwarded to
 •Canada, by the Car of Freedom, near
 20,000.
 Charles T. Torrey, too, who now sleeps at
 Mount Auburn, hurried to an untimely grave
 by the decree of slavelmlditig justice, for the
 crime of “doing unto others as he would
 (that they should do to him hut he las gone
 before.
 Torrey, Hopper, and Buggies!—how
 justly to each may l&gt;e applied the words of
 the poet

 FREEDOM of OPINION.—INFIDELS
 AND FREETHINKERS,
 i he world is full of hughcnr.i it is almost
 frightc eel out of its w its by them. Tlu.ro is
 no new idea elucidated—tu* ohl unjiopular idea
 brought to light, which, if suc h means were
 capable of accomplishing the cud, would not
 Bj&gt;eedily U* hugged out of existence by them.
 lieu Jenner, anxious to save humanity
 from one of iu most grievous and most pre
 vailing scourges, labored unueanedly to
 to bring into universal application his world-
 Ulessing discovery of vaccination, the buglers
 were let loose upon him: he was blas
 phemer and a counteracter of the laws of
 Providrnca—an infidel and a freethinker!
 Tin we who first brought steam into use as the
 successful conqueror of wind and tide, were
 m like manner beset; and let aiy oae, now
 adays, make a disco very or euforee i truth
 Which does not chune with the orthodox and
 fashionable sentiment, and he too may Uy his
 account with being liberally baited by the
 same adversaries.
 lint how absurd and irrational is all this
 Tru.se who are the leaders n these onslaughts
 ujK,n discoverers, are generally loud m their
 professions of anxiety for the advancement of
 truth; bow, then is it, that they are thus
 zealous in lbetr ttfTurt* to stay the progress of
 uepiiry l Ask them, What u truth! and
 their answer will m amount he, that their
 opinions, and their ojunuma only, are true.
 And they are so: these, atul none else, arc
 true to them; and yet their opinions may be.
 from beginning to end, only a tissue of f»l M
 hfHxl. Though palpalde and self-evident to
 others, every thing else u» naught but fiUac
 huod and error to them; and every one who
j preterda lo believe ShaJ 40 be,true to him,
 which has nut become his as it Were by right

 and subject to their control, but %ko to aim arj
 j depriving them of the inalienable right nfi
 thought. Even those who hare sifffered the 1
 i most from such tyranny bare often been,!
 j whea opportunity presented, ferocious in fctJ
 exercise. Scarcely had the reformers of F.u
 t”pc succeeded in wooing themselves from!
 j &lt;ho miad-debaeing thraldom of Popery, when
 Calvin, acajous for the prevalence of his
 opinions, sanctioned the burning of Sermus
 as a heretic. So. in Kngkad, during the
 reigns of Henry VIII., Mary and Elizabeth,!
 Popery and Protestantism being alternately in
 the ascendant, alternately oppressed ami al
 i ternatefy suffered. And when the Scottish 1
 Covenanters, after being hunted from roouu-,
 tain to mountain, and from glen to glen, for
 daring to bold opinions different from those in
 power,succeeded in establishing their right;
 to do ao, they also endeavored to thrust the
 solemn league and covenant down the,
 throats of all who would associate with them
 in action.
 «t* 4 j
 VY e have many manifestation* of this per
 secuting spirit, originating in the same desire
 of power, in the present day. It is no unusual
 thing to find men endeavoring to force thei
 adoption of their creed, by the arm of the*
 law, or bv the equally uncivilized means of
 excommunication, detraction, and calumny.|
 At one time, legislative acts ar* passed to*
 “prevent the desecration of the Sabbath,"
 at another time, those who do not see their
 obligation to hold any day sacred, but con
 sider everyday alike,” arc branded as in
 fidels and freethinkers. If they do not
 believe in the divine authority of a Christian
 ministry,” they are infidels and freethinkers J j
 If they oppose and expose our so-called
 Christian churches, for their indifference to 1
 the cause of humanity, and the shallowness'
 of their professions, as proved by thei*- sanc
 tion of the accursed slave-system, they are
 .infidels and freothinkers! Abolitionists are
 all infidels and freethinkers? Probably they
 are. Very possibly they do not believe in
 the Christianity which these churches believe
 in. Poor indeed, and worthless, and soulless
 would be their belief if they did. Preserve
 me from the adoption of such a creed It is
 cold, miserable, heartless, producing no fiuit,'
 j implanting no principle, checking no vice.
 W hen a man makes any discovery, he docs
 not strive to hide it. Truth will net he hid
 it does not wish to be hid it courts the light
 of day and the most searching scrutiny and
 th ere is no more sure ground on which the
 falsehood of any theory may be premised,
 than that those who maintain*it are unwilling
 that it should he subjected to the ordeal of a
 full and free examination.
 And this, after all, is the only of
 discovering the true, and of detecting the
 false. It is to very little purpose to pio-j
 duce a book of authoritative appeal, and to&gt;
 say of it, This is all true; I lielievc every
 word of it; those who do not believe what
 this book says, do not believe the truth.” Tim
 Mahometan has as good a right to say I
 (as he does say) this of the Koran, the'
 Chinese of the books of Confucius, and even!
 the savago idolater of the irrational doctrines'
 of his belief, as the professing Christian of
 the Bible. The Koran is no authority to the
 disciple of Confucius the Bible is none to
 the follower of Mahomet; and altogether—
 the books of Confucius, the Koran, and the
 Bible, are utterly valueless as a final appeal,
 lo the man who abjures all infallible authority.
 Everyone who values wliat lie considers the
 truth, will be anxious that all should adopt
 hia views. But thcro is only one way of
 compassing this object. It is not by the force
 of law it is not by the force of excommuni
 cation it is uot by the force of calumny but'
 only by making our truth the property and
 [msst'ssion of others. It is ours we prize it!
 highly; it is engrafted upon us—become a
 part of ourselves. When it is so engrafted
 upon others, they also will sec its value, and
 it will have become a part of them also.
 Men will still think for themselves, in spite of
 all the efforts of law, aud the calumnious 1
 aspersion infidels and [freethinkers! lo
 spitfc of all such opposition, tbc truth will
 triumph—the thought will out, as from!
 Galileo's dungcoo—“ The earth moves still.” 1
 Those who know what truth is, and its irre
 sistible power, can calmly say, in the words
 of the immortal Milton: Let truth and
 falsehood grnpple. Who ever knew truth put
 to the worse in a free and open encounter!
 She needs no policies, nor stratagems,
 nor licensings, to make her victorious those
 are the shifts aud Ute defences that error uses
 against her power.”—j. d.

 Pithy Prayer.—A short but comprehen
 sive prayer was once made by a Scotchman,
 a* follows.—“ Keep tny purve form the
 lawyer —and my body from the doctor —and 1
 my soul from the dcrU." He couldn't have
 asked for more in fewer words.
 The Bealtics of Law.—A suit lias re
 cently been terminated in Wyoming county J
 N. Y., in which the amount involved was
 $23, and the costs reached 800, or 1000. i
 The Court of Common Pleas, now in session
 here, was engaged a whole day in the trial of
 a cause, in which the sum at issue was about
 2 50. The plaintiff succeeded in getting a 1
 verdict in his favor—amount $l. Law is a!

 The following is from a London Corre
 spondent
 Losiww, March 18, 1918.
 e Public affairs are by no means in
 a satisfactory state. Tlie French are terribly
 embarrassed by financial difficulties, as mutt
 necessarily be the case, w ith a violent revolu
 lion like that which has just taken place.
 The bank of France has stopped cash pay
 ment there has been a ran upon the Savings
 Banks, which hare also suspended, and only
 pay four-tenths of all sums above two hundred
 francs in cash the remainder being paid by
 bills and stock. M. Ledru Rollin issued a
 very violent circular on the subject of the
 elections, which th« other members of the
 Government have disowned. Some violent
 scenes are said to bare occurred in conse- j
 quence. The mob are greatly in favor of
 Ledru Ilolliu, who threatened his colleagues
 that be would address them from the window.
 M. Gamier Pages said he would pistol him,
 if hs moved to do so. They have just issued
 a proclamation on the subject of the comiug
 elections, which appears to have been written
 by Lamartine. It breathes throughout a
 kindly and moderate spirit, and declares that
 all they desire is, that the conscience of.
 France” may speak in the approachingt
 assembly; that lh;ir power is only tempor
 ary, and will be lakl down the moment the
 nation is organized, and has appointed a
 regular government. Austria refuses to have
 any diplomatic relations with France. The
 King of Belgium is said to have called his
 Ministers together, and to have told them
 that if the nation desired it, he would abdi
 cate but he would not allow a single drop of
 blood to be shed, to keep him on the throne.
 The Ministers implored him to keep his
 throne, out requested leave to propose some,
 reforms. Leopold answered, Reforms! we
 must have reforms; you and tho representa
 tion are responsible if the required reforms are
 not immediately made. lam only an elected
 king, and must reign as the people wish me.”
 The king of Holland, also, has requested h«s
 Parliament to draw up such a measure as will!
 meet the wants of his subjects. All sorts of,
 movements are going ou throughout Ger
 many. I ain sorry to say, that there has
 been much violence in some places, chieffv
 Wurtemburg. The Duke d’Aumale and the
 Prince de Joinvillc, have quietly given up
 Algiers to the Republic.
 There have l&gt;ee:i a great many Chartist
 meetings in different parts of the country; and
 it seems evident that we are going to have a
 renewal of agitation. The difficulties of the
 government aad the disgust of the middle
 classes, in consequence of the grievous bur
 den of taxation, will help on the movement.
 W e have had the guns firing in honor ofj
 the birth of a princess, which took place tliisi
 morning at Buckingham Palace.
 Yours respectfully,

 Fkan'CS. A grand demonstration took;
 place, March 27th, in the Champ du Mars,.
 (Paris.) Great numbers of workmen, ar-'
 companiod by innumerable flags, assembled
 around the Tree of Liberty, which had'
 been planted the previous day, and which the
 clergy of Gros Caff lon had consecrated. In
 compliance with the wish expressed by a de
 putation who waited upon him, M. Ledru
 Rollin, Minister of the Intetior, went to the
 spot and addressed the people.
 M. Ledru Rollin recommended the work
 men to return to their labor to the cry of
 Vive la Republique!” The cry was imme
 diately echoed by the crowd, and shouts of
 Vive Ledru Rollin were also heard.
 Prussia.— By the Cologne Gazette of,
 March 22d, we have news from Berlin to the'
 20th inclusive. The Poles have been set at
 liberty, and bud celebrated the event with a
 great triumph accompanied by the people.
 The king has nobly and promptly re
 deemed his pledge to forget past auimusi- 1
 ties. The following general amnesty appears
 in the AUgamne Prtusick* ZtUunf, of
 March 21
 Yesterday, I declared that from my heart
 I had forgotten and forgiven. But, in order i
 that no doubt may remain of my whole peo
 ple being embraced in this forgiveness, and t
 because 1 will not have the great future of our’
 Fatherland now dawning upon us dimmed
 with painful reminiscences of the past, I here
 by proclaim pardon to all who ba«e been ac- 1
 cused of, or convicted political offence or
 offences perpetrated by tbe instrumentality of]
 the press. My Minister of Justice, Uhden, is)
 charged to give effect to this am
 nesty.

 Russia. —We read in a letter from St. Pe-
 trraburgh, of the 4th, that on learning that a
 revolution had taken place in France, tbe Ern-
 Eeror appeared indifferent, Hut said, France
 as become wild, and the French are mad.”
 There was a talk the day after of extraordi
 nary military measures having been resolved
 on, which appears to be confirmed; fur we*
 learn, under date of the l lib, in a send-off* tal j
 manner, that the emperor has given instruc
 tions to the Minister of War to place the
 unops on a war footing. His Imperial Ma
 jesty feels bound In adept this step by the
 terms of existing treaties with other powers,
 and, in tin* evcot of a necessity arising, for

 raling them forever. And can me expect any*
 thinghotter—can tn? took for benevolence or

 ish m abeery h W ooid he anitmtmnaMe,
 txxree n corrupt tree cannot bring forth
 irooj fruit.*’ Therefore, knowing that with
 out associative action we cannot render 15-
 rient aid to this holy cause, we affectionately
 invite the CMipcration of the citizen* of Roch
 ester and the public generally’. We ask them
 to bear in mind the injunctions of Jesus, “AU
 things whatsoever ye wouhl men shookl do tu
 you, do ye even so to them.” Remember,
 also, the beautiful parable in which lie calls
 our attention to the sick and to tlkwe wbo are
 in prison, and concludes by the forcible asser
 tion, “Inasmuch as ye have tlone it tooneofthe
 least of these, my brethren, ye have done it
 unto roe.” We fed assured all that have
 hearts to feel, ami are careful to attend to the
 monitions of conscience—all who are deter
 mined to live for the good of our race, instead
 of devoting all their time to their own per
 sonal ease—all who feol bound to improve the
 precious time allotted to them here, by pro
 inoting as much as possible the cause of truth
 and righteousness in the earth, will come for
 ward in the work of laboring to banish forerct
 the demon of slavery from our land and in
 so doing, instead of an example of corruptioa
 and wickedness, we should be a light to the
 world.”
 W e hope no one will feel too poor, nor any
 too rich, to enlist in this’holy cause. The
 Christian's influence, in whatever situation, is
 always salutary, and will certainly produce its
 good effects. We ask for the aid of men and
 of women we call on the old and the
 young, the farmer, the mechanic, and the
 merchant. We ask all and every one to give
 ns their help to devote what they can spare,
 rither of money or of the fruits of their la
 l&gt;or, to the work of restoring men and women
 lo themselves, to their manhood, to the rights
 tnd blessings with which they were endowed
 iy our Creator.
 For this object, we propose holding a Fair
 n Deemnlier next. We ask the females in
 he adjoining towns and country around us, tn
 ret up sewing circles, and prepare such arti
 cles as will be most saleable, and to come, fur
 lish tables, give us their company, and help
 is, not only in selling those things thus pre
 pared, but in convincing the public uiirnl of
 he necessity of our perseverance and fidelity,
 ind thus be helpers in hastening the day of
 emancipation.

 The motives which have actuated tlie author if
 preparing the above-mentioned work. are solely a
 desire to Interest am) enlighten the twiMie iniml; or
 a wilyrt intimately connected with the happmes* m
 i misery of a hirfc portion of the htaman family; aae
 l In a relation of hacks ami testimonies, which ik
 assertion* ran annul, to remove a deeply-runted pro
 jhdien, existing in the minds of mam, respecting the
 African rare-
 I It is an important qtirvtion whether the Negro j«
 constitutionally, an*l thercflire irrrntrdiallv inferior
 to the white man, m the power, of the mind. Much
 I of the future welfare of the Iwman rare depends on
 tlie answer wliich «|rri«nrr ami farts will tivnish
 to this question; lor it coneen not only tlie vast
 imputation of Africa. Nit many millions of the Negro
 rare, who are loratctl elsewhere, and tlie whites who
 i arc becoming mixed with tlie black rare, in countries
 where Slavery exis*s, or where it has existed till
 w ithin a recent period. M;thv persons have ventnr-
 I ed upon |»enMnptory &lt;V&lt; isions on lx&gt;th sides of the
 question; Imt the majority appear to l« still imsatis
 tied as to tlie real capabilities of tlie Negro rare.—
 Their present actual inferiority- m many respect.--,
 comparing them ns a whole w ith tlie limiter colour
 ed portion of mankind, is too evident to be dispute I;
 Imt it must lie I mine in mi-id tluit &gt;liey are not in a
 fit condition for a fair comparison to lie draw n be
 tween the two. Tlieir present degraded stnfc may
 be easily accounted for I v the eimunstanfes iunidst
 wliich Negroes have !ivc&gt;f, Imtli in tlieir own country
 and abroad. Ifa single instance can be adduced of
 an individual of the African race exhibiting a genius
 which winild be considered eminent in civilized Euro
 pean society, we have a proof that tliere is no incom
 patibility between Negro organization and high in
 tellectnal power. Hut it is not one alone, but man v
