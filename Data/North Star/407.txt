 hiiuwledge and rejoice ai the w ide spread in

 j. general lone of lbe northern political
 r n and the professions of tlu* political par
 we still led deeply impressed with ihe
 "Ur and importance of continuing to ope
 ii upon the public mind by means ot the
 and the voice of the living speaker, well
 i v.iio that for all the anti-slavery action
 ivt* w itnessed in either of the panics, we
 .k bted w holly io the earnest and fearless
 n v naiton of radical anti-slavery truth.
 Ut -.dved, That we liail with sincere grat

 j(ju i" (by the people of California) ol a
 i in.-oiuiion in which slavery is forever pro
 tiibiltd.
 0 Kesolved, That then* is ample power un

 i io ilus dire alternative, but firmly be
 uni slavery will be finally abolished by
 :il v o-oper.itiou ot the friends of freedom, both
 Norili ~iul South.
 I Resolved, That vve regard ihe institution 1
 i.i AiiKif-an slavery as belonging in its origin
 most barbarous ages—a relic ot tlie
 ii'Oiiuable form ot war, and that what
 t r ,-s and aspirations we may indulge in
 .-’ercTtct to the bettering of our social, poliii
 i ;,l ,J religious condition, aside from ihe an
 ii-sMvuy platform of action, we hold and be
 iha’t through the instrumentality of the
 1 nned .'Mates Government and the American
 fluffh. slavery in this country will he over
 ’hrown.
 j. Resolved, That recognizing the duty to
 withdraw all voluntary support from the slave
 svsipui. to maintain personal punty and con- j
 6 iei,cv, and to neglect no opportunity to
 a*--, tin* anti-slavery question upon the hearts
 nhe people, we earnestly recommend to all
 droiiliuniats to abstain from the products of
 slave labor, and prelei products ol tree la-
 M.r -.I far as is practicable.
 Rt'-ulved, That inasmuch as llu* slavehol
 det has no right to keep hi' slaves in bondage,
 Old theiefor*.' that tho siave has a light to es
 aj»e to freedom it lie can, and we have con
 pi-ntiv itti right to hiudei him from doing
 1;, retake and re-enslave him, and as
 ■At have*no light to make promises which
 [iiiimt lightfully be kept, or laws which can
 not rich thill v be obeyed, it follows that the
 provision of the American Constitution which
 the giving up ot the runaway slave
 o his master, ought never to have been adopt
 ed. and ought not now to be obeyed, nor have
 vc any right to promise obedience to it.
 Resolved therefore, That we hereby repeat
 ti* announcement of our fixed purpose never
 n. aid in the recapture and re-enslavement of
 tbe escaping bondman, nor tupromise support
 •i oitedience to the Constitution, while it con
 •jitc ihe provision alluded to, but will always
 •oik* best of our ability, as opportunity of
 j*is. help the fugitive to gain and keep that
 priceless blessing which he seeks, and to
 a Let, lie has an inalienable right.
 Resolved, Fuat we have no right to aid o
 promise to-aid, in putting down by bloody vi
 olence an insurrection of the slaves tor free
 •Join, because if it is right to fight in defence
 &lt;•1 our most sacred and precious rights, the
 slaves would be light in such an insurrection,
 ■Hid of course to fight against them would f)&lt;j

 to fight in defence* of our own lights, still
 iiiu,-*; must it be wrong to fight against the

 Therefore Resolved, That while (HeCon

 tort oi the slave to win liberty by violence, w&lt;
 lave no right to promise, and will not promi*

 The sth of November, so much dreaded
 in the North of Ireland had passed off tran-

 France. —The Paris Correspondent of I lie
 Times writes on Nov. 2nd
 “The Legislative Assembly presented a
 most animated aspect to-day. The former j
 Ministers arrived at an early' hour, and were
 received with marked benevolence by the
 members of the majority. M. Dnfaure and
 de Toquevilie resumed their former sea.a
 close to Gen. Cavaijjnac. None of ilie new i
 Ministers were present at the opening ot the
 silting. j
 Gen. d' llautpaul read a paper, giving a
 programme of the policy of the new Cabinet,
 from which the following is an extract.
 Peace abroad, guaranteed by the dignity
 becoming to France energetic maintenance
 of order at home an administration more
 than ever vigilant and economical of the fi
 nances of the Stale such is the programme
 dictated to us by the interests ot the country,
 the confidence of this Assembly, and the per
 sonal conviction ot the Chief of the Govern- j
 merit.”
 At the fiist rank of our duties we place i
 the piotection of labor in all its degrees and
 forms. We, wish toe farmer and laborer, j
 more and more reass ired respecting the fu- I
 ture, should find at last completely thal con- j
 fidence w'hich is beginning to revive.”
 We also desire iliat that security should
 spread to other regions, reanimate the labors
 of intelligence, and restoie to capital ami lo 1
 credit a spring too long relaxed.”
 The Cabinet, in accepting the burden «&gt;t
 affairs which it dufriot seek, has counted on
 your sympathy and support your exalted j
 reason and patriotism have given it that
 light.”
 The programme was received without
 any marks of approbation. There was only j
 a slight laugh on the lelt when the General
 descended the tribune, and the Assembly af
 terwards adjourned.”
 j The policy ascribed to the President on the
 j Russian and Turkish question is gratifying.
 He has boldly declared that France must as
 sume a decided tone worthy ot her dignity
 and character. His Ministers are not so
 strong in their opinions on the matter.
 Rome.—The Eternal City is still sutleimg
 i from the iron rule of the Cardinal Triumvi
 -1 rate. One of their recent and most tyranni
 cal acts, is the suspension of the works on the
 j railway to Naples, whereby thousands are
 \	hrown Out of employment. They call it a
 useless scheme, “tending to inundate Rome
 with worthless foreigners.” All the univer
 sities in the Papal States are to remain closed,
 until further orders.
 j Sgi. Savelli, with a view of checking polit
 ical discussion, has forbidden barbers to have
 more than four customers at a time in their
 shops.
 Among the many arrests lately made at
 Viterbo is that of the well known computer
 Maestro Sclli. A list of lomteen persons
 have appealed in the Roman journals, who
 have l&gt;eeii condemned by. couit-rnartial to va
 nous periods of imprisonmeut, excepting one.
 1 who is condemned to the galleys for twenty
 years.
 Austria and Hungary. —The Austrian
 1 punts speak ot the suffering of the refugees ,i
 Widdin, as being very great. It is said that
 3000, under the apprehension of being forced
 to embrace Islannsm, had returned to their
 own country, and had entered the Austrian
