 STANZAS.
 I’ve sat and seen one liright wave chase
 Iu fellow on the strand,
 Then fall away, nor leave a trace
 Upon tbs priutless Hand;
 Though scares tlie pelibles felt the sliock,
 The waves had worn tlie solid rock.
 I’ve sat and Wajdßfe Autumn wind
 Amid the bra^^mplay.
 So softly mild, kind,
 It scarcely stirdßi the npray;
 Yet soon it bore Spring's verdant birth,
 To wither on iu native earth.
 I’ve sat and seen the evening sun
 Sink from the golden sky,
 His long, bright race of glory run,
 And clone his golden eye;
 So slow he passed, scarce changed the light.
 And yet he left thc_world in night.
 And like yon sea is Human Life-
 Events, like billows, roll;
 Moment on moment, strife on strife,
 That change us to the soul;
 And joys, like Autumn leaves, fall fast—
 Hope sets—and Being’s light is past.
 I’ve stood on Earth’s most daring height,
 And seen day's ruler rise,
 In his magnificence of light,
 To triumph through tire skies;
 And all tlie darkness of tlie world,
 Far from his shilling presence hurled.
 All, too, that fades upon the earth,
 Too weak to linger here,
 Re-blossoms with a second birth,
 To deck the coming year;
 Shall Hope, then, Man’s eternal dower,
 Be frailfei titan a fading flower 1
 Ab, no! like Autumn leaves that die,
 That bloom again in Spring,
 Fresh joy* shall rise from those gone by,
 And purer incense bring;
 And when, like suns, Hope sets in night,
 Shall she not beam from worlds more bright 1
 THE INDIAN HUNTER.
 Oh, why does the white man follow my path,
 Like the hound on the tiger’s track 1
 Docs the flush of my dark check waken his wrath!
 Does he covet tlie bow at ray back!
 He has rivers and seas,
 Where the billows and breeze
 Bear riches for him alone;
 And the sons of tlie wood
 Never plunge iu the flood,
 Which the white man calls his own.
 Then why should lie come to the streams wher&lt;
 none
 But the red skin dare to swim!
 Why, why should he wrong the hunter!—one
 Who never did liarm to him!
 The Father above thought fit to give
 To the white man corn and wine:
 There are golden fields where he may live.
 But the forest shades are mine;
 The eagte hath iu place of rest,
 The wild horse where to dwell,
 And the Spirit that gave the bird its nest,
 Made me a boms as well.
 Then back!'go bark
 From the red man’s track,
 For the red man’s eyes are dim,
 To find that the while man wrongs the one
 Who’uever did harm to him.

A tCMOJI ©Jf LIFE AMD DEATH.
 “The trial of William Freeman, for
 the murder of John G. Van Neat, in
 cluding the Fvidcnce and the Argu
 ment! of Counsel, Stc., &amp;x., by Benj.
 F. Hall, Counsellor at Law,” has just
 been issued in a fair octavo (law-book
 fashion) of 50* pages, by Derby, Mil
 ler Sl Co., Auburn. Although the
 leading facts in this case are tolerably
 well known, wa carl attention once
 again to them, because of tbeir great
 intrinsic interest, and the salutary moral
 they inculcate.
 William Freeman was a poor youth,
 of mingled African and Indian blood,
 j who was horn in Auburn and had gen
 erally lived in that place or its vicinity,
 subsisting by his labor in various ser
 i vile capacities, but more usually idle.
 He had next to no education, and being
 i without the means of paying even £2U
 1 pew-rent, very little religious instrue
 lion. We doubt whether this lost
 sheep’’ was ever looked after by a pro
 fessional shepherd until the wolves oi
 the law got hold of him. When 16
 j years old, he was arrested for a horse
 theft he had uo sort of hand in, con
 i victed on the testimony of the actual
 thief, and sent for five years to the
 State Prison. Consciousness of the in
 I justice of his imprisonment, combined
 with a natural passion for wayward
 roving, made him an unruly prisoner,
 and he was consequently beaten over
 the head till his hearing was impaired,
 and his intellect also. He had two in
 sane sisters. In prison, he brooded on
 the injustice of his sentence, and in
 sisted on redress. He came out in
 Sept. 1845, still harping on his wrongs,
 and insisted on having payment for the
 time that the State had robbed him of;
 but asking nothing for the brutalities to
 which he had been subjected. Never
 was there a more righteous demand
 than this, yet the law proffered him no
 redress, and the magistrates to whom
 he sOccessively applied, scouted his
 appeal. Thus refused, he wandered
 about, doing a little work occasionally,
 and living in the hut of a poor black
 washerwoman, saying little, and seem
 ing generally sullen and stupified, save
 when aroused to insist that somebody
 ought to pay him for five years’ hard
 labor in the State Prison. Thus he
 brooded, his head fractured by one of
 the blows he had received in prison,
 until he became a savage maniac, and,
 starting otf three miles South on the
 evening of the Pith of March, 1846,
 he entered the house of a worthy far
 mer named John G. Y r an Nest, just as
 the family were retiring to rest, and
 with a knife he carried stabbed five per
 sons, Mr. and Mrs. Van Nest, and
 their son George, so that they died in
 stantly, Mrs. Phebe Wycoff mortally,
 and a Mr. Van Arsedale severely,
 leaving them all weltering in their gore.
 V an Arsdale overpowered and drove
 him from the house, when he stole a
 horse from the stable hard by, mounted
 and fled. W hen that horse failed, he
 stole another, and continued his flight,
 until arrested next day by pursures,
 at a place in Oswego county 40 miles
 off.
 Of course, so awful a tragedy created
 intense excitement. Horror and the
 thirst for vengeance were aroused.—
 Large numbers hastened to the scene
 of butchery, especially on the occasion
 of the funeral of the victims, when
 the Reverend officiator held forth as
 follows:
 If ever there w as a just rebuke
 upon the falsely so-called sympathy of
 tne day, here it is. .Let any man in
 his senses look at this horrible sight,
 and then.think of the spirit with which
 it was perpetrated, and unless he loves
 the murderer more than his murdered
 victims, he will, he must confess, that
 the law of God which requires that
 he that sheddeth man’s blood, by man
 shall his blood be shed,’is right, is just,
 is reasonable. Is this the way to pre
 vent murder, by sympathy It encour
 ages it. It steels the heart and nerves
 the arm of the assassin!
 But capital punishment is said to be
 barbarous, cruel, savage. What does
 it amount to? Why, that God com
 mands that which is barbarous, cruel,
 savage! Most daring blasphemy!—
 all punishment is for the good of the
 culprij, or else it is tyrannical! The
 wretch who committed this horrid deed,
 has been in the school of a State Prison
 for five years, and yet comes out a
 murderer! Beside, it is an undeniable
 fact that murder has increased with the
 increase of anti-capital punishment
 spirit. It awakens a hope in the wretch
 that by adroit counsel law may be per-;
 verted, and jurors bewildered or melted j
 j by sympathy; that by judges infected j
 with it, their whole charge may be in
 favor of the accused; that by the lav
 ishment of money, appeals might bej
 multiplied, and by putting off the trial, j
 witnesses may die. Why, none of usj
 are safe under such a false system as
 this; for the murderer is almost cer-J
 tain of being acquitted! If I shoot a
 man to prevent him breaking into my j
 house, and killing ray family, these
 gentlemen will say I did right. But it
 he succeeds, and murders my whole
 family, then it would be barbarous to
 put him to death! Oh, shame, shame!
 I appeal to this vast assembly to main
 tain the laws of their country inviolate,
 and cause the murderer to be pun
 ished.”
 Such appeals were hardly needed!
 to produce the state of feeling desired.
 Vengeance! vengeance!—speedy, cer
 tain, terrible—was the general cry. A
 highly moral and religious mob were I
 barely prevented by stratagem from
 seizing the poor wretch on his way to
 jail and tearing him to pieces. If there
 had been the least doubt entertained
 of his being surely and quietly put to
 death, nothing would have prevented
 their tearing him limb from limb.
 His trial commenced on the 24th of
 June following. Nobody supposed it
 could have any other than the one re
 sult. In hundreds of such cases the
 perpetrator has been sent to the gal
 lows with as little ceremony as is em
 ployed in killing an ox. But Gov. Sew
 ard, with bis .partners, Hon. Christo
 pher Morgan and Samuel Rlatcbford,
 (David Wright, Esq., was added by
 assignment of the court.) had volun-
 teered to conduct the defence—Gov. i
 Seward having satisfied himself that the.
 accused was truly insane. Freemen
himself desired no counsel, suggested
 no defence. Tbe whole county was
 bent on banging him; and a lea# potent
 reason has sent many a man to tbe gal
 towa who bad never killed anybody. A
 jury waa first empanneied to try tbe
 question of Insanity. After a trial of
 intense interest, covering the whole
 1 ground of the nature of Crime and In
 i sanity, the question was given to tbe
 i jury at midnight on the 4th of July,
 and at 8 P. M. of the following day,
 the jury returned a verdict of We
 find tbe prisoner snfficiently sane in
 mind and memory to distinguish be
 tween right and wrong.” This the
 judge declared a verdict of smnit and
 j ordered tbe prisoner to be put upon
 trial for his life. Gov. Seward ex
 cepted, but was overruled, and the trial
 j proceeded, Attorney General John V an
 1 Buren leading for tbe 'prosecution.
 I Every step was contested on each side
 with consummate ability and desperate
 i resolution; and on the 23d the trial
 resulted in a verdict of Guilty, followed
 on the 24th by a sentence of Death.
 But this was not final. The defend
 ant’s counsel took exception, and car
 j ried the case up to the Supreme Cotltt,
 where the judgment below was reversed
 and a new trial granted.
 The trial never took place. The
 Circuit Judge in the interim visit
 ed the prisoner in his cell, tested
 his mental condition, and refused to
 try him again. He remained in jail,
 evincing unmistakable and increasing
 evidences of mingled insanity and idio
 cy, down to his death, which occurred
 on the 21st of August, 1847.
 Such are the leading facts exhibited
 in the volume before us, which, not only
 as a book of reference in trials where
 insanity is pleaded, but to every one
 who takes an interest in the nature of
 Crime, of Insanity, and of their con
 nection with each other, will have an
 abiding interest. We presume it may
 be found at the law bookstores.—A*. Y.

 PRISON COMPANIONSHIP.
 How long the lamp of conversation
 hangs on to burn between two persons
 only, is curiously set down in the follow
 ing passage from Count Confalonieri’s
 account of his imprisonment:—“ I am
 an old man now; yet by fifteen years
 my soul is younger than my body! Fif
 teen years I existed (for I did not live—
 it was not life) in the self-same dungeon
 ten feet square! During six years 1 had
 a companion; during nine I was alone!
 I never could rightly distinguish the
 face of him who shared my captivity in
 the eternal twilight of our cell. The
 first year we talked incessantly together
 —we related our past lives, our joys for
 ever gone, over and over again. The
 next year we communicated to each
 other our thoughts and ideas on all sub
 jects. The third year we had no ideas
 to communicate; wc were beginning to
 lose the power of reflection. The fourth,
 at the interval of a month or so, we
 would often open.our lips to ask each
 other if it were indeed possible that the
 world went on as gay and bustling as
 when we formed a portion of mankind,
 j The fifth we were silent. The sixth,
 he was taken away, I never knew
 whei;e, to execution or liberty; but I
 was glad when he was gone; even sol
 itude was better than the dim vision of
 that pale, vacant face. After I
 was alone only one event broke in upon
 my nine years’ vacancy. One day (it
 must have been a year or two after my
 companion left me) the dungeon door
 opened, and a voice—whence proceed
 ing I know not—uttered these words—
 By order of His imperial Majesty, I in
 timate to you that your w ife died a year
 ago. Then the door was shut; I heard
 no more; they had but flung this great
 agony in upon me, and left me alone
 with it again.’
 ADVANTAGES OF HARDSHIP.
 Great men are the natural growth
 of a strong soil. They never spring
 up of themselves, like the flowers and
 grasses, from the richest and warmest
 earth. Rock-rooted, like the giants of
 the vegetable kingdom, they are of
 slow growth and their duration mav
 always be measured by their growth.
 Reputations that are suddenly acquired
 are never worth having.
 Great men are the natural growth of
 hardship, and trial, and suffering. The
 human heart is made all the steadier;
 j and the stronger by that of which it most j
 complains—hardship. The soul itself;
 is strengthened by opposing influences
 —by countervailing duties: even as the
 mainmast of a mighty ship is stayed by
 ropes pulling difterent ways. With- 1
 draw but the least of those many ropes;;
 tear away but a small portion of that
 which causes the whole fabric to
 groan and creak, and what becomes of
 the tottering spar and the unsteady
 ship
 So, too, are great men the natural
 growth of opposition. They are up
 lifted—as the kite is, or the thunder'
 cloud—not by favoring, but by adverse 1
 influences. AH rise against the wind,
 not with it! Hardship is tbe fulcrum
 of greatness: Opposition is that solid
 platform which Archimedes asked for,
 when he threatened to upheave the
 earth. Where Pyramids are to be
 tumbled from their base, or cities over
 thrown—there must always be opposi-
 tion of a corresponding magnitude to j
 begin with. Be of good cheer, then,
 ye who go about doing good! With
 out opposition you would have nothing
 to hope for. 1 here would be no place
 for your fulcrum—no field for the play
 of your levers.
 But you complain of the great pres
 sure upon you; of a pressure within
 and without; of a pressure above and
 about you. As well might you com
 plain of the pressure of the atmos
 phere. It is that which upholds you in
 your place. As well might the diver
 complain of the pressure of the sea,
 when he goes dowu into its depths after
 pearls. But for the very greatness and
 uniformity of that pressure, he could
 not steady himself. Let it be taken off
 as upon the top of a high mountain,
 and he falters and trembles—a little
 more—and be perishes! Withdraw that
 very pressure which be so bewails, and
 his buoyancy is gone, and with it his
 uprightness—his lungs are ruptured
 —and the mao himself crushed for
 ever!
 Fishes, according to Josh fin, have
 been caught in depths where they must!
have borne a prenare of SO tone to the
 square foot of surface. Wood at a cer
 tain &lt;kpth ceases to be buoyant —the
 pores neing filled erith water. Hence,
 the timbers of wreck, in deep water,
 will not rise.
 Thus are men strengthened by their
 multiplied obligations by the very
 weight of the vast and solemn duties
 piled upon them. Upon every side, and
 upon every side alike, they feel the
 pressure—and therefore it is that they
 are not ovewhelmed. W ithdraw but
 a small portion from either side—from,
 within, or without—from above, or
 about—and there is an end of the
 man.
 At with a well-constructed arch, so
 is it with man. The greater the prea
 sum that fails to crush him, the strong
 |er he is. Like a mighty river in its
 fullness and strength, whatever barrier
 fails to check its course —whatever ob
 stacle it encounters, and oversweeps,
 and bears away, but helps to augment
 its power. Courage, then, courage
 ye that are abroad as Reformers; and
 be thankful that barriers are piled up in
 your way that mountains are heaped
 upon the arches of your strength;
 that men have not been w;th you from
 the first, but rather against you.—JV.

 FAMILIES OF LITEHARV MEN.
 The Quarterly Review, in discussing
 i an objection to the Copyright Bill ol
 Mr. Sergeant Tallourd, which was ta
 ken by Sir Edward Sugden, gives some
 j very curious particulars about the pro
 geny of literary men. “We are not,”
 says the writer, “going to speculate
 about the causes of the tact, but a fact
 it is, that men distinguished for extra
 ordinary intellectual power of any sort,
 rarely leave more than a brief line ol
 progeny behind them. Men of genius
 have scarcely ever done so; men of
 imaginative genius, we might say. al
 most never. With the one exception
 of the noble Surrey, we cannot at this
 moment point out a representative m
 the male line, even so far down as the
 third generation, of any English poet;
 and we believe the case is the same in
 France. The blood of beings of that
 order can seldom be traced far dow n
 even in the female line. With the ex
 ception of Surry and Spencer, we are
 not aware of any great English author
 of at all remote date, from whose body
 any living person claims to be descend
 ed. There is no other real English
 poet prior to the middle of the eigh
 teenth century, and we believe no great
 author of any sort, except Clarendon
 and Shaftesbury, of whose blood we
 have any inheritance amongst us.—
 Chaucer’s only son died childless
 Shakspeare’s line expired in his daugh
 ter's only daughter. None of the oth
 er dramatists of that age left any pro
 geny; nor Raleigh, nor Bacon, nor
 Cowley, norßutler. The granddaugh
 ter of Milton was the last of his blood.
 Newton, Locke, Pope, Swift, Arbuth
 j not, Hume, Gibbon, Cowper, Gra/,
 i Walpole, Cavendish, (and we might
 (greatly extend the list,) never married.
 1 Neither Bulinbroke, nor Addison, nor
 Warburton, nor Johnson, rior Burke,
 j transmitted their blood. M. Renou
 ard’s last argument against a perpetui
 i ty in literary property is, that it would
 ■I be founding another n iblesse. Neither
 ‘jealous aristocracy nor envious jacobin
 ism need be under much alarm.
 When a human race has produced
 its bright consummate flower” in
 this kind, it seems commonly to be near
 its end.
 Poor Goldsmith might have been
 mentioned in the above list. The theo
 ry is illustrated in our own day. The
 two greatest names, in science and in
 literature, of our day, were Davy and
 Walter Scott. The first died child
 less. Sir Walter Scott left four chil
 dren, of whom three are dead; only
 one of whom (Mr. Lockhart) leaving
 issue; and the fourth, (his eldest son,
 though living and long married, has
 no issue. These are curious facts.
 EDUCATORS, CHERISH HOPE I
 Of all moving sights of woe, the
 most mournful is that of a hopeless
 child. A single glance at its listless
 limbs, its dull eye, its languid move
 ments, shows the mischief that has been
 done. The child is utterly unreliable
 |—a mere burden upon the world.—
 He has no truth, no love, no industry,
 no intellectual power in him; and if he
 i has any conscience, it is the mere re
 mains—enough to trouble him without
 i doing him any good. This is an ex
 treme case, and I trust a rare one.—
 But cases of repressed hope are much
 more common than they should be.—
 There are too many children who are
 baulked of their mother’s spmpathy be
 cause she is busy or fretful, or of their
 father’s, because he is stern. Too many
 little hearts are made to swell in silence
 because they cannot get justice, or to
 burn under the suspicion that their as
 pirations are despised. Alter this,
 what can they do? At best,they carry
 their confidence elsewhere, and make
 their chief interests away from home;
 and it is too probable that they will
 give up their plans and aspirations, and
 sink down to lower hopes.
 In the case of every human being,
 hope is to be cherished from first to
 last; not the hope of the particular
 thing that the child has set its mind
 on, unless the thing itself be gone—
 but the hopeful mood of mind. The
 busiest mother can have nothing to do
 so important as satisfying her child’s
 heart by a word or look of sympathy;
 and the most auxious father can have
 nothing so grave to occupy him as the
 peril he puts his child into by plunging
 him into undeserved fear and disap
 pointment.—Anon.
 Exfosl’re to the Sc a.— There are
 few points which seem less generally
 understood or more clearly proved than
 the fact that exposure to the sun with
 out exercise sufficient to create a pers
 piration will prodfice illness; and that
 the same exposure to the sun with suffi
 cient exercise will not produce illness.
 Let any man sleep in the sun he will t
 wake perspiring, and very ill; perhaps
 he will die. Let the same man dig in the
 sun for the same length of time and he
 will perspire ten times as much and be
 quite well. The fact is that not only
 the direct rays of the sun but the beat
 of the atmosphere produce abundance
 of bile,and powerful «\srcise alone will
 carry off that bile.
THE PRESS.
 The importance mod responsibility oi
 the press is mighty and overwhelming.
 Its beoeficial effects ia society can
 only be calculated by the relative posi
 tion it occupies to the wants of the peo
 ple in establishing those principles and
 spreading those truths broad-cast in the
 world, which tend lo enlighten the in
 tellect, arouse the faculties, and se
 cure the happiness of the whole. But
 when the Press consents to stoop from
 its proud position to become the mouth
 piece for a party of corrupt politicians,
 and will employ all its influences, and
 exhaust all its energies, in corrupting
 and misleading the public mind upon
 the great questions of national policy,
 for no other purpose than securing the
 spoils of office and the aggrandisement
 of the few, then will principle and true
 patriotism award to her the condemna
 tion she has )hstly merited in sacrificing
 principle for party, and write the in
 scription for her monument, for the
 gaze of the whole world in characters
 of Living Light— Glory Departed.
 National Reformer.
 JUDGE ALLEN.
 A correspondent of the N. Y. Eve
 ning Post, furnished the following arti
 cle for that paper of Saturday last:
 “The Hon. Charles Alien, who so
 boldly denounced the nomination of
 Gen. Taylor in the Convention at Phil
 adelphia, and declared “the whig par
 ty dissolved,” is one of the most re
 spected and influential citziens of the
 Bay State. He has repeatedly repre
 sented that State in both branches of
 the Legislature. He received hut de
 clined the nomination of his party to
 Congress in the district represented bv
 Mr. Hudson, on the retirement of Gov.
 Lincoln. He was one of the commis
 sioners, most in the confidence of Mr.
 Webster, upon the Ashburton treatv.
 Within three months he has declined
 the nomination of Gov. Briggs to a seat
 on the bench of the Supreme Court.—
 He was chosen a delegate to the Con
 vention from “the heart of the Com
 monwealth,” on aceount of his known
 opposition to Southern rule. He is
 universally regarded in Massachusetts
 as an upright man, in whom reliance
 may always be placed; as one of the
 few prominent men w ho neither ask nor
 will accept office; and as one of the
 most gifted advocates and learned coun
 sellors of the State. From these facts
 the public wilfjudge whether he is like
 ly to recede from 1113 position, or to be
 mistaken in his opinion concerning the
 sentiment of Massachusetts.”
 How to Vote. —Every true Whig,
 who loves his country, and wishes foi
 her to go onward to the fulfilment of the
 great mission confided to her, and to
 the attainment of the destiny to which
 the founding of our government looked,
 must deeply lament that any circum
 stance should &lt;s?cur to weaken the
 bonds which have held the party to
 gether, or to place it even in cqiv
 oca! position, in relation to the grea*
 principles it has so often proclaimed.—
 Under the circumstances which exist,
 we know no better way than for every
 man to recur, for himself, to original
 principles, audio shape his own course
 as they may dictate, without reference
 to the course of others; and we trust
 that any attempt to browbeat or intim
 idate, on one side or the other, muy be
 met as it deserves. Massachusetts

 Influence of Young Men.— Throw
 a stone into the water and mark how
 circles widen until they are lost. Such
 is influence—your influence, young
 men. On which side will you throw it,
 virtue or vice? You have the power
 of partially redeeming the w’orld, or
 making it tenfold more wicked. Which
 will you do? A judgment day before
 you, and a long eternity for reflection,
 tell us how will you labor! It is a fear
 ful thing to live, and a terrible thing to
 die, w ith the ghost of worse than, w ast
 ed moments and debased talents, stare
 ing us in the face. At the time the
 Roman liberties were attempted to be
 destroyed, Cataline, knowing the in
 fluence of young men began by corrupt
 ing their minds and leading them to the
 commission of daring crimes. This
 shows that he understood human nature
 —with the countenance and support of
 the young men,we cuold regenerate the
 world: without their support compara
 tively futile would be all our efforts. If
 such is your influence, beware where
 you throw it. Live to elevate and bless,
 —not cruse and destroy—feel that you
 are living for other worlds and that
 your immortal destiny depends upon
 how- you live, move and act.
 Novel Application of the Wa
 ter Cure.— Priessnitz and his disci
 ples have furnished us with many cu
 rious anecdotes of the wonderful effects
 of water, but they have not, so far as
 we know, pretended to cure matrimo
 nial squabbles by the application oftbeir
 favorite remedy. The following story
 from a Swiss journal, however, would
 seem to be indicative of a power in the
 clear, universal liquid,” that has been
 little thought of hitherto. Every paper
 should copy it for the benefit ot the af
 flicted
 A married c uple, who had for sev
 eral years lived in a state of anti-con

 made an appointment to each other at
 a notary’s to sign the deed of separa

 of law they had to cross a lake, and as
 it happened, the both embarked in the

 THE public are revtectfally inhumed, that finer
 the philosophical deductions of the Ira inert Dr.

 experiments of Mr. Hemmer of England,* bar#
 recently ami indubitably established the fact, that
 the conclusion* a* which the undersigned arrived by
 the sense of touch, in 1844, are in harmony wilt
 natural and pbysiolcgii al laws— to wit, that the
 human hotly, in a health} condition, is in a fwiliu
 rltctriral stuff, arul that the electrical emanations
 from the euticular surface, indicate health, or the
 sympti rrs aad character if diet a sc— there is acme
 reason to hepe, that certain rhysiciars, igroraul *f
 there principles or natmal laws, a knowledge af
 which is essential to the safe ami intelligent practice
 of the healing art, will erase their vocileiations
 against the positive ii.ectbjcal stati af the
 hi man body, and will hesitate to dissuade lh*so
 w h« m they have failed to relieve of tlicir complaints,,
 from seeking nature’s remedy at the NoiiTHAlir-

 of science, the undersigned may le permuted here
 to repeat Ins experience, that, in all cares where the

 to a fiord rrli* f. Un the oilier hand, when tbs part#
 of the body alluded to, aie in the electio-j ositiva

 for a ure.

 already convinced the pit lie i f the safety it tiulli

 of disease, and practising the cure, tlie recent scica
 tilic demonstiation of their coriectnesa, hv Trofesscr
 Means ami Mr. Hemiuer, coukl not fail to (odium#
 the most increduh.ss.
 Gratefully appreciating the credit so generously
 awarded for his success as a Hydropathic I’racti

 evinced I y those w horn he lias had the pleasure to
 relieve ot their rouij laints, the undersigned wilt
 assiduously endeavor to sustain the credit, and meiit
