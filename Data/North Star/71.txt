 Mv Dea* $730 I saw it recem]; atat*
 in wine paper, that the land of Ireland va
 uwned by *3,000 Und-holders, and l propo*
 to draw a comparison bet warn land nxmopul;
 in Ireland and the I n.led Stave*. In lookiei
 rtrrr the tart* and figures, I find the folio*
 inf result*:
 Ireland ha* 32.000 fcjnare mile* and 23,001
 owners, giving to e;,ch, one and a third *qnan
 miles, tl las 20.000,000 acres, which give* earl
 landlord a fraction less than 000 acres. Thi
 Slave States of the l etted Suite*, have abmi
 727,000 {uale miles of territory and a bow
 300,000 slave-holders, which give* each ovei
 two square mile*. They have about 5U0.000,
 OOOof arms, which gives each slave-holder ore:
 1,500 acres.
 I have not calculat *d fractions in this esti
 mate, but have given w hat i» very nearly tin
 fact* in fractions. Making all allowance fei
 the fact, that there may be tn the slave StaUJ
 some small land-holder* —say 200,000, yet w 1
 havr an aggregate amount of land in cad
 tyrant’s hands of over 1000 acres. The vas
 mass of land in those States, must of neeessi
 tv Ik* in the hands of the slave-holders.
 The slave Stales have about 8,000,0000 o
 population scattered over this area of land
 the States Constitutions of most if not all iht
 slave State*, render it just about impossible
 for any thing but a large slave-holder and
 land-holder to reach their local legislatures;
 this is a well known and undeniable fact, and
 what is the result up»n our 1\ S. Senate?—
 Tbcso legislatures appoint these Senators, and
 Hence we have one-half or more of that august
 dignified body, made up of actual slave
 holders—in fact none but a slave-holder has
 a s;at in that body The United
 States Constitution first makes a league w ith
 these in an holders, and authorize* them to ap
 point two Senators to the 1 S. Senate —their
 local ktgislatures are the appointing body; this

 rottenness in every bone, tainting every
 muscle, paralysing every nerve, smiting the

 The friends of a free ptea in France, as
 fumbled in mobocratic bands to destroy the
 oils of the National Era, the Anti-Slavery
 paper published in Washington, ami wen
 w ith difficulty prevented from accomplishing
 j thetr di-moiiish designs.
 This mob was composed oflhe anli-Wilmoi
 Proviso democracy. This reign of terror al
 the Capitol is a doomed tiling, and unless the
 outbreak is tenderly handled, will only tend to
 defeat the aims of the victors.
 Is not the u liole affair a shameful thing to
 send back to the disenthralled serfs of Europe,
 from the Capitol of (he I'nited States A
 moh in Ihe presence of the National Legisla
 ture, (of this mode) republic) and probably
 excited and led on by many of its members,
 avsr nibling to tear down the only press in the
 Capitol that dare to advocate the cause of the
 slave at home, and rip* for executing, on the
 spot by Lynch law, any connected with the
 unfortunate slaves in their attempts to escape
 from ih *ir lionds.
 The French with noble consistency, have
 abolish ;d slavery in all their colonies and
 when the accounts of the American vengeance,
 dealt out on tlie actors of this attempt to be
 freemen, shall reach them, they may well
 with their National shrug exclaim, in the lan
 guage of the glorious Madame Roland, when
 about to submit her neck to the axe of the
 sanguinary Republican, Robespierre—“ Oh
 liberty! what crimes are committed in thy
 name!’’
 Since writing the above, the arrival of the
 Steamer Duchess of Orleans, with intelligence
 •hat another Republic is burn in Europe,
 Prussia has throw if ofT her King that
 Poland is striking for Freedom, encourages
 the belief that soon, Moscow in Russia, and
 Washington in the I'nited .States, will be the
 only national capi ols that can furnish a mob
 in destroy a free pres* and that the only vic
 tory against human liberty this year is in our
 national capital, over sixty negroes. It is in
 /tunes of such disgraceful occurrences that the
 death of Freedom's boldest champion, John
 Qiiiney Adams, is ti-it to he truly a national
 calamity.
 '1 he attempted exodus of these poor breth
 ren was utiiortunate. They ought to have
 been better prepared. (hie good cannon, well
 managed, would have crippled a dozen steam
 ers. If white men were to undertake to run
 away from human blood-houuds, they see to
 it, that tin* Telegraph wires were cut the dis
 tance ot every fen miles in the direction of
 their bight. More than this thrv would do
 '-hey w ould pull up the rails of the rail-roads,
 and stop the speed of the iron horses. Do
 you think friend Douglass, it w ould be an un
 pardonable sin ibr slaves to do the same?
 The correspondent of The Aitc York Tri
 lunr informs us, that one of the chivalrous
 sons ot the city of George Washington, broke
 through the crowd and unde a plunge at the
 'upturn, who was bound m Republican chains,
 and marly severed his ear. What a graceless
 ti-ig! Even barbarity itself was ashamed of
 the deed—meanness said it was mean, and
 Hell blushed to the neck. A minister, proba
 bly ill Rev. Ct Ai iAH Brown, was the first
 to sell bis man. Great God! what cruelty—
 w hat ueviiism W e have many such minis
 ters. They talk about ihe gospel—thev make
 long prayers—they lift up their hands to hea
 ven. and repeat the Golden Rule. Louis
 Rhiiippc laughs at this—Mettcmicli opens his
 eyes, ami Nicholas shrugs his shoulders and
 says that this is rascality among rascals, and
 intolerable hypocrisy among hvpocrits.

 SAVINGS HANK.
 The letter in to-Jay’s paper, sicneJ 11. O.
 Waggoner, we take from the North Star,
 published in Rochester, New York, and ed
 ited by Frederick Douglass—a colored man,
 whose name has already become familiar to
 tli? general reader. The author of the letter
 is a mulatto now residing in this city, who
 lias at times assisted as a compositor in our
 office, and from Ins unassuming manner, and
 regular habits, has commanded the esteem of
 all his co-laborers. \Ye do not, however, in
 sert the letter merely to exhibit the ability of
 ot colored man to get up a letter worthy of
 publication, but we do it more for the very
 excellent advice it gives to the colored popu
 lation, in both their public and domestic econ
 omy, and as worthy ot consideration by the
 wonting portion ot the white population, who
 determine to rise in the world by industry and
 frugality.
 Wagjpnar** p i an j s practicable, and, if
 carried into offset, would be the sure means of
 improving the condition of hi* race—who, by
 the way, so far as relates to those in this city,
 are very generally sober, industrious and very
 useful citizens, in the various occupations in
 which they are engaged.
 The plan is no more nor less thin a Sa
 vings Hank—and there an? none in this city
 who could not, by a little eff»rt, pay in the
 instalments prupoited by him, and in a few
 years would amount to a sum that would be
 ample to accomplish some great and useful re
 sult. Money begets money. A disposition
 for economy and frugality become strength
 aned by practice. We hope Mr. Waggoner
 &gt;»ili stimulate bis colored brethren to make a
 beginning, even if it is at first a small one,
 upon this project. If they are coouselled by
 »n experienced financier in appropriating their
 funds, and an upright and honest lawyer, tq
 taking securities,the results will astonish U,eiti
 in a few vears.
 And while we are upon this subject, we
 would particularly eomine id this letter of Mr
 Waggoner's to ihe careful [lerusai of all the
 editors of the Democrat and Tnbtme, of thu
 city —in whose voluminous essays upon fi
 nanciering, in their columns, there cannot be
 found aa much real, practical common sense u
 is contained in this one letter.
 The plan is practicable, and cannot but
 succeed if'officers and attorneys aro ritelligenl
 and honest. These they can find Obaw
