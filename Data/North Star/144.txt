 eJcr'C'flon-Vn-s of th# T ilwn#.
 Washington, Ju’v, 12. !®l®.
 Public attention has not been suf
 ficiently called to the tact that in th*
 negotiations between Mr. 'l'rist and
 the Mexican Commiasioners, the
 strongest rvpugnincc uas manifested
 by the Mexican Commissioners, to the
 cession of Territory with a prospect oi
 the introduction of Slavery therein
 The following is an extract from Trial’s
 letter to Mr. Buchanan, dated on Sep
 tember the 4th. I*l7.
 Among the points which came
 under discussion, was the exclusion ol
 slavery from all Territory which should
 pass from Mexico. In the course «&gt;t
 tlicir remarks on the subject I was told
 that it U were proposed to the people
 of the Lnitcd States to part with a
 portion of their territory in order that
 the Inquisition should he therein estab
 lished the proposal could not excite
 i greater feelings of abhorrence than
 those awakened in Mexico bv the pros
 pect of the introduction of Slavery into
 any Territory parted with bv them.
 Our conversation on this was perfect
 ly frank.
 I concluded by n-suririg them that
 the hare mention of the subject in am
 treaty to which the United States was a
 party, was an absolute impossibility
 that no President of the United States
 would dare to present anv such Treat'
 to the Senate and that if it were in
 their power to offer me the whole ter
 ritory desciihcd in our project, in
 creased ten-fold in value, and in
 addition to ih it, covered a foot thick
 all over with pure gold, upon the single
 condition that Slavery should be ox
 cluded therefrom, I could not for a
 moment entertain tlm offer nor think of
 cormmmieating it to Washington.’*
 How will the American people stand
 in the estimation of the whole civilized
 world, if they shall extend the curse of
 slavery over Territory thus acquired,
 and inflict its evils upon the Mexicans,
 who have been transferred not onlv
 without their assent but also against
 the most earnest remonstrances that
 they made. B.
 SCENE IN THE SENATE.
 The following disgraceful scene oc
 i curred in tiie Senate on Saturday
 Mr. Butler rose with a copy of the
 New V ork Herald in his hand, and
 called flu; attention of’ the Senate to the
 fact that that journal had published a
 report of the proceedings of the Senate
 in Executive session upon Hen. Jvear
 neys confirmation. The correspondent
 said that Mr. Benton furnished a copy
 ot the resolutions offered hy him, which
 Mr. Butler said was a gross violation
 ol the rules of that body, and he pro
 posed that the Senate should proceed
 Ito enquire into the fact in secret ses
 sion.
 Mr. Benton rose, pallid and quivering
 with rage, took up the Senator’s epi
 thets of dishonorable and disgraceful,
 i and shouted at the top of his voice,
 jthat the man who accused him of di.s
 -1 honorable conduct, lied in his throat!’"
 —This lie repeated more than once,
 i with increased vehemence, lie said
 he had never quarrelled in his life,
 though he had fought, and fought to the
 death. lie was ready to maintain
 I everywhere, that the Senator lied in
 his throat. During all this time Mr.
 Benton was loudly called to order hy
 the President and hy many intelligent
 i members.
 i According to the correspondent of
 the Journal of Commerce, Mr. Ben
 ton said
 ‘1 never had a quarrel in my life.
 1 have fought some sometimes—fought
 to a funeral—hut never had a quarrel.
 If any one accuses me of anything
 dishonorable, lie shall have the lie in
 his throat. I make no quarrel. That
 man shall have the lie in his throat. I
 will adjourn the matter to another place,
 2kc.
 Mr. Butler arising and turning fierce
 ly to Mr. Benton, cried out I am
 ready to meet you anywhere. Mr. Ben
 tau repeated—You have the lie in your
 throat. Luckily, though daggers were
 spoken, none were used.
 2«0 SLA&gt; ES.»»
 It is a fact worthy of remark, tha*
 every story circulated to the disparage
 ment of General Taylor, turns out on
 examination to he an enormous exag
 geration of an utter falsehood. The
 charge that he had purchased a large
 tract of land on the Rio Grande, and
 was purchasing slaves in Washington
 to wuik it. as ue showed the other day,
 belongs to the latter class; the one
 which asserts that he is the owner ol
 "T? 0 slaves belongs to the former. In a
 conversation the other duy with a gen
 tleman—himself a Democrat—w ho had
 resided in the vicinity of Baton Rouge,
 he stated that he was well acquainted
 with the circumstances of General Tay
 lor; that at But»m Rouge, he owned but
 a very small tract of land with a very
 few slaves; that in Mississippi, thirteen
 miles above Bayou Sura, he owned a
 large plantation for which he had paid
 yJO.OOO, and that the slaves thereon,
 did not exceed in tnnnber*Ss field hands
 with a proportionate number cmnloved
 about the buddings, and that ail the
 slaves owned by General Taylor did
 not exce&lt; d 63.
 So akr all, it can only be said that
 General lay lor is a slaveholder, and
 just about such a slaveholder as Henry
 *ay and i} this is a valid objection, it
 holds p *c'j against every prominent
 man in the whole South.' But even
 intelligent friend of the Uniou knows
 flint tins is not au objection recognized
 by the Constitution.— Herald.

 AM. HA I*. MISS. UNION.
 The July number of the Magazine
 contains the minutes of the Second
 Annual Meeting of the Union, and of
 meetings, of the old and new Board,
 together with the Annual Report of the
 Executive Committee, itc. It is of
 great value, and should be carefully
 preserved for reference. Much to our
 regret, we find that the Report of the
 Committee of Nine on the Third Article
 of the Constitution is omitted, the
 Editor having failed, as he says, of
 obtaining a copy of it.— We really
 hope this omission may be supplied in
 the next or some future number.
 The following analysis of the pres
 ent membership of the Union, supplies
 some interesting facts
 I'he number of Members now in
 the Missionary Union, constituted such
 by the payment of one hundred dollars
 i each, is I j.W; of whom G'il have been
 made members by churches 354 by
 associations, conventions and mission
 ary societies and 4*25 by their own
 contributions or those of their friends.
 Of tlie whole number, 111 reside in
 Maine, 50 in New Hampshire, 33 in
 Vermont, 325 in Massachusetts, 7d in
 Rhode Island, 07 in Connecticut, 111
 in New York, 50 in New Jersey, 9 in
 Delaware, 143 in Pennsylvania, 85 in
 Ohio, 9 in Indiana, 9 in Iliin &gt;O, -21 in
 Michigan, 3in Wisconsin, *2 in lowa,
 18 in States not embra d in the home
 lirld of the Union, and 43 in other
 counties, nearly all of whom are our
 missionaries.”
 It will he observed that the whole
 number of members is less than 154)9.
 Of the rest of the denomination, no
 individual, and no church or other
 religious body has any voice in the
 doings of the Union, or in its assumed
 direction of the foreign missionary
 work. They retain no other connection
 with the missionary enterprise, as con
 ducted by that organization, than that
 of giving their money. And the great
 mass of the Northern churches, with a
 membership of *285,009, submit to this!
 Why? Hoes it result from tho love of
 peace, or from moral cowardice and
 servility It may seem very amiable
 rn them, to yield up without a struggle
 the powesr which the fifteen hundred
 have seized and held by usurpation.
 But can they so dispose of their res
 ponsibilities Or have they any light,
 by tamely bowing their necks to the
 yoke, to impose it upont eir successors
 for all corning time —Ex.
 A TERRIBLE ADVENTURE.
 On Thursday morning last, seeing a
 number of persons hurrying toward the
 Chaudieie Falls, we inquired the cause,
 and were informed that a crib oftimber,
 with two men upon it, had passed over
 the Big Kettle,” and that one of them
 had been drowned, while the other was
 stuck on the table rock, upon this side
 of the river, immediately opposite the
 suspension bridge. Having repaired
 to the scene of the accident, we found
 this melancholy tale verified. It appears
 that being unaccustomed to navigate
 the channel leading into the slide, which
 is perfectly simple and easy of access,
 they had neglected to keep close enough
 to the shore, until, too late, they found
 themselves drawn with gradually in
 creasing rapidity toward the tearful
 abyss, through which no man living has
 ever been known to pass, although ma
 ny have found in its deep w aters a grave.
 Upon entering the rapid immediately
 approaching the fall, one of the men
 whose name we have since learned to
 have been Baptiste Beaudrau,) that ot
 the other Paul Filardeau, jumped off
 the crib toward the shore, since when
 no vestige of him has yet been seen.
 But amongst the anxious crowd gath
 ered upon the bearh, which could not
 have numbered less than 409 per
 son.-. sympathy for the unfortunate dead
 seemed almost wholly merged in the
 most intense and absorbing interest lor
 the salvation of the living. Standing
 upon the small rocky island, upon which
 the miraculous intervention of a merci
 ful Providence had placed him, with
 ‘‘hell of waters roaring around him
 on all sides, his was a critical and fear
 tul situation. In comparative safety,
 save from the constant exp 3 ji eto the
 spray, some proposed tout he should
 remain until the water would fall suffi
 ciently to permit his passing; while oth
 ers. who understood the danger better,
 suggested that means should be adopt
 ed at once to convey ban to the main
 land.
 In pursuance ofthis determination, a
 stone having a suing attached to it, was
 alter several unsuccessful attempts
 thrown across the wat» r. A rope was
 then fastened to the string, which was
 passed over a high post, and drawn
 across by i ilardcau, and made fast to
 the rock; a large iron ring having been
 pot upon the hawser, a email rope was
 tied to it, a itw feet at one. end being
 allowed to hang dow n for the purpose
 of securing around Ins body. This
 uLo passed over by a string as liefore.
 Ibe arrangements being completed,
 the signal was given for him to prepare
 for bis precarious vovoge. This he
 did with a great deal of coolness, ar
 ranging the rope round his body with
 admirable skill. During the time thus
 occupied, the excitement became
 breathless. It arose to the highest
 possible pitch, when apparently misun
 derstanding signals made to him, to
 await 9 me further arrange meats upon
the shore, be poised himselfwpoo por
 tion of the crib, which hsd lorwed a
 jam’ upon tue rock,and launched off
 bold!/ wsth naught but the thin air be
 tween him and eternity. The moment
 was a thrilling one. A portion of his
 body dipped into the foaming w aters be
 low—we turned to look upon the effect
 produced upon the multitude around.—
 .All seemed to hold their very breath,
 while with pallid cheeks, and eyes in
 tensely fixed, they gazed upon the
 sceue. A moment passed, which to
 many there doubtless seemed an age,
 the rocks resounded with one loud deep
 shout in which even the roaring of the
 torrent itself was lost. Drawn swiftly
 along the hawser by the ring, in less
 time than we have taken to narrate it,
 the shore is reached in safety, and con
 gratulations arc poured upon the hero of
 this adventure, for his miraculous cs
 caj&gt;e from sharing the untimely fate ol
 his unfortunate companion. Long w ill
 his extraordinary passage be remem
 bered from this island, which may
 henceforth be appropriately designated,
 j Filardeau’s Rock.” —Fhjtoicn Gaz.
 Bvtown is on the Grand Ottaway
 River, far in the interior of Canada.—
 The situation of Mr. Filardeau was one
 iof great peril; quite as much so as it
 he had been driven on one of the small
 islands directly above the falls of Ni
 agara. font. Jidv.
 AWFUL SC CNF
 A day or two ago, (says the editor of
 1 the Albany Daily Express) we saw a
 j woman raving with the delirium tremens
 She was young, handsome, and a mo
 ther An uucontroiuble passion for
 intoxicating drinks soon made a hell of
 a once happy home, drove a kind
 hearted husband and Fatli rto despair
 and death and brought t.ie wretched
 mother and her two young boys to the
 degradation of public shame and street
 beggary. Her ravings were terrible.
 She fancied herself a fiend in perdition
 compelled by a superior power of dark
 ness to thrust her children into fierce
 flames, and hold them their till their
 bodies were burned to a crisp Her
 descriptions of what she saw in her
 madness, and of what she fancied she
 was obliged to do were awful and
 indescribable. Occasionally the wretch
 ed being would fly to the farthest corner
 of the room, uttering piercing screeches
 ot agony, and pressing the palms of her
 hands over her eves in a vain attempt
 to shut out the horrid spectacle presen
 ted to her disturbed vision. Then, as
 if impelled by an irresistible power,
 she would rush forward, clutching wild
 ly at what she thought were her childrcr
 and with loud outcrie, plunge thou
 again and again into the furnace of lire
 mingling horrid curses and imprecations
 with the most touching and ferveni
 prayers.
 This hallucination haunted the mis
 erable creature long alter she was
 rendered powerless by tiie restraints o
 the straight jacket, and was succeeds
 by others, even more terrible in char
 acter, and too shocking for detail
 which continued until death closed the
 scene.
 Lamartine’s Creed.—This is t
 matter of some interest at the presen
 moment to every friend of liberty ir
 genera! and of the French Republic in
 particular. He says:
 “1 believe in Christ, because he has
 introduced on the earth the most holy,
 the most fruitful, and the most divine
 doctrine that ever shed its beams ot
 human intelligence. Christ has spo
 ken as reason speaks. The doctrine i:
 known by its morality, in the same
 manner tnat a tree is known by its
 fruits; the Iruits.of Christianity are in
 finite, perfect and divine, the author ol
 which is the Divine Word, as he s(
 styled himself.”
 The true philosophy of Bonnets
 j—The London Herald talks like i
 bock on the subject of bonnets. A
 small bonnet, it says, for a lady is ai
 1 emblem of gaiety or liberty. She cai
 see with the corners of her eyes ir
 j such a bonnet, and survey the whoit
 i semicircle of her nose in the centre
 1 But in a Quakeress’s bonnet she car
 only see beyond her nose, and a few
 degrees on each side of it. If a gen
 tleman should look at her from the
 opposite side of the street she observ
 eth him not; if even a horse should make
 a snap at her arm as she passeth along
 the pavement, she doth not percieve it.
 She is imprisoned in a coal skuttle con
 trived on purpose both to prevent and
 to elude observation.—But with a nay
 little French boiyiet bu upon We
 back hair, like a hat upon a peg, the
 forehead all exposed, auu eyes at lull
 liberty to describe the whole semicircle
 of human vision, a lady is made up for
 conjugating the verb to see active and
 passive voice, in all its moods tenses
 and persuus. This is gay, and fore
 bodes the same sort of anarchical pro
 ceedings in the domestic sphere, that
 the bonnet rouge foreshadows in trie po
 litical world. Nothing so quiet, and
 sober and matronly-looking tor a wo
 man, as a Leghorn that lies round the
 chin and hangs down the back like a
 coalheaver’s hut, or rolls up behind like
 a parson's shovel, not cocking up as it
 tne face w ere behind, in the Nell Gwynn
 style. A woman so attired is sure to
 be discreet, modest, subject, timorous,
 apt to scream, very much afraid of all
 strange people, and well armed with
 jealousy and suspicion of all evil-look
 ing persons, such as foreigners with
 hairy laces, or drab-colored moustaches
 hanging over their mouths, or natives
 wnose linen is nowhere visible, but
 whose manners, notwithstanding, affect
 the style of the court or the stage, or
 something very different from ordinary
 hfe; au atfectioiiate wife, a fund mother,
 an excellent economist, aud a seveie
 critic of all irregular living at home or
 abroad. Such ladies, we fear, are
 going out of fashion, all owing to the
 smatl Fr&lt; nch bonnet, which makes
 them so very gad-about and unsettled
 at home.

 Whether all the anticipations of Mr. Sqoonet
 would be realized by the frill adoption of his theory,
 we do not Imre stop to enquire; but we heartily com
 mend his endeavor to the notice of all who love a
 transparent foicible diet ion—intrepid independence—

 of sect or tat tv. Asa judicial wl iter, Im*ha*a depth,

 in bold and oiigm.il thoughts. The illegal causes ol
 poveity are stated, and a number of impoitant propo
 sitions bearing on the subject laid ilowe; and, on the
 whole, we coasi ier it a work well worth studying—
 affording a? it does many valuable hints to tire states
 man and political economist.”
 The Bangor Gazette say s An able and certain
 ly original work, from tire pen of Lvsan ,er Spooner,
 Esq.—author of that powerful book which demon
 strates me unconstitutionally of American .Slavery.
 There is no writer ol the age, of logical acumen more
 searching than Spooner.,’ This n-ww. tk is des
