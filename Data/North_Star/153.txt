 CHAPTER X.
 Conjectures.
 These are, sir, the general outlines o('
 the political route, in which I wish toj
 seo our friends #nd enemies Walk; in
 which I wish that the press anti speech,
 executive and Chambers, should guide
 France and Europe: it is the only road
 which has not an abyss at its termina
 tion, or which conducts to a future.
 You know it; before the catastrophe
 which afflicted our hearts without sur
 prising our foresight, for wc did sue it,
 prompt, certain, inevitable, at the end
 of the false, narrow, retrograde path,
 where blindness and error were urging
 on those we loved to have as guides,
 whom we followed as the soldier should
 follow his chief —to death, but not to
 suicide —these were our thoughts and
 our words. Alas! barren thoughts and
 words, which the breath of adulation,
 or of intrigue, never suffered to reach
 the cars of kings; which the wind of
 popular passions may also carry away,
 perchance,to-day! Nevermind; they
 will fall dry and cold upon the sand, or
 upon the rock, but they will not die
 there forever; a true idea, a social
 idea, fallen from heaven on mankind,
 never returns to the void; once it has
 germinated in some true hearts, in
 eome logical and healthy minds, it bears
 in itself a something vital, divine, im
 mortal, which cannot entirely perish;
 passions, vile interests, ignorance,
 habit, prejudices, envy, may crush it
 beneath their feet, may mutilate it with
 the sabre, or the axe: its fruits are
 delayed for a day, for a century per
 haps or two. Providence has its hand
 full of centuries,and counts them not in
 its works: but at the century marked,
 at the fatal day—perhaps we are at it
 —the living idea whose deeds havoa
 been shed abroad, and multiplied by
 the very storm, bursts forth at one mo
 ment in all minds. All parties send it
 out again as their own; all opinions
 own it as the bottom of their common
 thought; foreseen or not, an event hap
 pens, may be an accident, and the
 world is renewed. The idea of liberty
 has all these characters: if France
 would, if powerg knew liote, this great
 fact of social renovation might be
 worked out under our eyes: nothing
 opposes it, nothing resists it in things,
 as in minds; the hour has struck.
 Rut i till Francel do powers know

r virtue wre are deficient in, and that it h
 which makes rnc doubt and tremble foi
 ourselves! Political virtue? I knoa
 tiiat liberty produces it by exercising
 it; but there must be some beforehand
 to sustain liberty. When Rome coulc
 i reckon but one Cato, Cccsar was noi
 far distant.
 But do the potccrt know hotel No, ii
 they continue to seek their support in
 an element which is now beginning tc
 fail, which will be found wanting still
 1 1 more in the future, the aristocracy; in
 'the restriction, and not in the expan
 sion, of political right and action.—ll
 they continue to keep their hands
 clenched instead of opening them wide,
 if they will reign and not guide; if they
 will pitch their tent for a day, and force
 the social mind to a precarious hah in
 the defile at which the nineteenth cew
 tury has arrived, and where it will be
 smothered, unless it pass through with
 daring power, at the head of its gener
 ations. Thus, possibly, two things are
 deficient at this epoch, without which
 all theory falls to the ground, all ex
 perience vanishes in air—a country and
 a man.
 For want of the man, the political
 man, the man complete in intelligence
 and virtue—a man, sublime and living
 impersonation of an age, strong in the
 strength of his own and his epoch’s
 conviction; Bonaparte of speech, hav
 ing the instinct of social life and the
 lightning of the tribune, as the hero
 has that of death and of the battle-field,
 palpitating with faith in the future, Co
 lumbus of liberty, capable of discover
 ing another political world, of convinc
 ing us of its existence, and of leading
 us to it by the persuasion of his elo
 quence, and the domination of his
 genius! For want of such a man, an
 archy may be there—vile, hideous, re
 trogressive, dcm.'igoguic, sanguinary,
 yet impotent and short-lived—for even
 anarchy supposes strength. Crime has
 also its party in France; the scaffold
 has its apostles. But crime can never
 he a political element; crime is the
 most anti-social of human things, be
 cause society is not, and cannot be,
 other than morality and virtue. This
 party is beyond the law of the country
 and of civilization; it is to politics what
 robbers arc to society—they kill, but
 they d not reckon. Society has neither
 a necessity nor an appetite for blood;
 it has not even to fight—nothing to
 overturn b fore it—all is made straight
 under its steps. That imitative admi
 ration for the men and the tvorks of
 terror, is nothing hut the sophism
 which sometimes accompanies the
 hangman, as it precedes him always; it
 is aa after taste'of blood, shed and
 drunk in our epoch of shame, whiMi
 some maniacs take for thirst,and which
 is only the tiger’s dream.
 For lack of political virtue in the
 country, at the first earthquake of the
 powers, at the first hurricane on the
 tempestuous sea of liberty, a general
 clamor will arise. Put back, give up
 all the way we have made, take in sail;
 the most precarious port will be good.
 The most obscure, the most ignorant
 soldier, w ill don the cocket-hut and the
 grey coat, and fancy himself a Bona
 parte; will sabre liberty and civiliza
 tion, root and branch, and w ill exclaim,
 My people,” until they detect that
 the hero is only a straw-stuffed effigy,
 and until they seek another w ho wears
 tyranny more gracefully, and dresses
 up slavery better! This free people
 does not love liberty enough; they al
 ways think they see the temple of glory,
 with a hero in the doorway, open to
 admit them, and to avenge them for a
 new anarchy. They are mistaken; the
 hero is no more, and liberty is their
 only asylum.
 Let us, then, seek after political vir
 tue; let us seek after it both for our
 selves and others this period will take
 care to exercise it; let us seek it where
 it is to be found, in a strong convic
 tion, in a sincere faith of mankind’s
 progressive destiny, in a religious re
 spect for our dignity as man, in a se
 vere contemplation of* the divine issue,
 that God has placed before society as
 before individual life. This issue is
 himself; it is the perfection of the indi
 vidual, and the perfection of the gener
 ic being, human nature,which ought to
 bring the virtuous man, and society it
 self, nearer to God.
 The divine thought, applied at length
 to policy, is already fermenting in the
 young generation which presses on us:
 that generation —young, strong, moral,
 religious—it is all the hope for the fu
 ture! Saint Simouisin itself is a happy
 symptom; bold plagiarism which comes
 from the gospel, and which ought to'
 return there, it has already rescued j
 some enthusiastic spirits from the vile 1
 doctrines of industrial and political ma
 terialism, to open to them the indefinite!
 horizon of moral perfection and of so- 1
 cial spirituality. That is, in reality,'
 the point to be gained; but by the;
 route Christ has traced out, which his
 progressive doctrine enlightens iu pro
 portion as man advances, and upon the
 real and solid grouud of humauity, up
 on the respect for all rights, upon the
 accomplishment of all duties, upon the
 reform, and not upon the destruction,
 of the only basis which God has hith
 erto given to his tanuiy and to society
 —property. It may be, humanity will
 discover, one day, another social prin
 ciple: nothing can be denied, nothing
 affirmed, of tiio unknown. The hori
 zon of humanity draws back and re
 news itself, in proportion to tbe steps ii
 has made; the Divine Word alone
 knows where it will lead us. The gos
 pel is full of social, and yet obscure,
 promises; it unfolds itself with time,
 but U discloses to each epoch only that
 part of tb&lt;r route it ought to attain.—
 Saint Kimonisw traces u parallel road,
 but in the clouds; it w a religion
 without a God; it is Christianity with

i out fisitb, y which is the life oi it; it i
 the gospel without the reason ant
 knowledge of man. All that there ii
 in it sincere, elevated, or aspiring to i
 11 more perfect and more divine terrestria
 I* order, will soon perceive that it canno
 j walk without foundation; that it nroa
 reach to the skies by its desires, but tt
 i human reality by the facts, end wil
 return to the principle which gives ai
 once speculative truth and practical
 force; the indefinite hope of the per
 fection of civil societies, and the rule,
 the moral, and the measure which
 alone can direct them there. The prin
 ciple, from whence we all emanate, be
 lievers or sceptics, friends dr enemies,
 is Christianity! its logical deduction is
 social perfection; it is this which has
 made modem liberty more true than
 ancient liberty; it m this which pre
 pares for us again political and civil
 charity, more true than the narrow,
 exclusive, and egotist patriotism of an
 tiquity: its reign w ill be no other than
 the rational epoch, the reign of reason,
 for reason is also divine.
 A word here: By this future and
 perfect reign of Christianity, 1 do not
 mean that material reign of Christian
 ity, that palpable and universal empire
 i of the Catholic principle, predominat
 ing in fact over all the political powers,
 subjugating even the world to religious
 truth, and giving also the lie to the sub
 lime of its author, My kingdom
 is not of this world.” This doctrine of
 religious policy realized in social forms
 —a doctrine which some men of faith
 and talent are vainly rekindling to-day
 —has never had the assent of my rea
 son. It is seeking, in a crowned mys-
 I ticism, in a posthumous theocracy, in
 a priestly aristocracy, a principle and
 rule of human power which exists no
 where but in despotism, or political ar
 istocracy. Truth itself should not be
 manifested, nor imposed by forms ol
 material domination; for her agents
 will be always men. Men alter or cor
 rupt all which they touch with the
 hands of man, and make of the liberty
 of the children of God, a degrading
 tyranny for us. The only form ot man
 ifestation, and empire of religious
 truth, is speech—is liberty. The only
 yoke of hearts and understandings, is
 conviction; that is the only empire of
 Christian truth, the only yoke we all
 bear with liberty and with love, when
 the immortal trunk of Christianity,
 which renews its branches and its foli
 age, according to necessities and peri
 ods, shall have borne and multiplied its
 last fruits for us.
 Let us now revert to the present day,
 and conclude. You see hope and light
 in a distant horizon, in the future of
 the generations which follow us; un
 certainty and darkness over our actual
 fate, our immediate future. Mean
 while, hope prevails; and if each of
 us, without regard for party opinions
 or desires, places himself in the truth,
 which is immediately before him, seeks
 there his daily duty, and employs his
 strength without calculating it, the re
 sult leaves not a doubt: the social world
 will have made an immense step, and
 even its fall will have advanced it sev
 eral ages. I ain no prophet, but rea
 son prophecies; an eternal law, a mor
 al law, which the ancients called fatal
 ity, which the Christians name Provi
 dence, and which is nothing more than
 divine will, enchaining consequences to
 principles, effects to causes, is working
 eternally for or against us, according
 as we start from the false or the true.
 In the private life of the individual, as
 In the social life of empires, this law
 shows itself incessantly, by its happy or
 vengeful applications; it requites, even
 in this world, every man according to
 his works, according to his truth and
 virtue. It is the shadow of divine jus
 tice that we perceive on the earth.-
 With this divine law before our eyes,
 we can and do in reality predict every
 day, with a full and infallible assu
 rance.
 We can then predict, that if a right
 has been omitted or voluntarily violated
 in a political fact, its absence or its
 violation will plunge the power and
 the country in a long and laborious ex
 piation.
 That if thn power, innocent itself of
 the political necessity from whence it
 springs, comprehends this dictatorship
 of events, this mission of a social des
 tiny, and entirely employs it without
 any self-seeking, for the disinterested
 salvation of the country, in the sincerei
 and broad foundation of a liberal andj
 rational order; it will triumph over all
 obstacles, it w ill create w hat is its evi
 dent missiou to create; and will last so
 long as these necessary things ought
 to last, time to finish their work; itself
 a transition to another order of things
 more advanced and more perfect.
 That if it docs not comprehend it
 self, and if it does not profit to the ben
 efit of liberty and humanity by the fu
 gitive moments which are given to it;
 if it does not ae« that a long, broad,
 and straight road is open, without ob
 stacle before it, and that it can carry
 thereby the spirits, laws and facts, to a
 point from whence they cau no more
 retrograde; if it count* itself us some
 thing, if it stops or returns, it will per
 ish, and several ages, perhaps, will
 perish with it.

 the men of fidelity, religion, monarchy,
 liberty and progress, persist in setting

 I ty, above their rights ami duties, as

 murder of the social future; and they
 are preparing for themselves, fur tbcij
 country, for their children, one of those
 deplorable chastisements that Provi
 dence inflicts sometimes as severely on
 error as on crime. For us, innocent
 of this error, if we do not repudiate
 our part of the ndSfehment, which will
 make no choice, let us repudiate at
 least all participation in the fault. We
 shall at least have protested if out
 voice cannot be understood, it will at
 least have been lifted up! Let it re
 sound again! Let us follow this light
 which shines for us, this light which all
 can see, that light which illumines
 political morality with the same lighl
 as private morality. Let us do the
 best we can under all given circum
 stances. Events do not belong to us,
 but our determination wholly belongs
 to us; events arc never neuter, conse-
 I quently we never have the right to be
 1 so. There is always, in all combina
 tions of human affairs, an ill to avoid,
 a- good to seek, a choice to make.—
 i Some one has said, that in times of
 revolution, it is ofttimes Jess difficult to
 do one’s duty than to know it; hut the
 moral of Christianity has a light that
 always illumines our steps sutficient
 ly, in displaying always an end, which
 I the instability of events and the stormy
 wind of fortune can neither veil nor
 move—the weal of humanity. The
 choice which this morality commands
 us, let us make it from day to day,
 hour to hour, according to reason, con
 science and virtue: let us yield nothing
 of it to our enemies, nothing to our
 friends even; let us endure hatred and
 insult from the one, smiles and raillery
 from the others. Before each mai,
 before each epoch, before each deed,
 there is a duty; in each duty there is]
 a virtue, in each virtue a present or
 future reward. Each of these duties,
 accomplished by us, is, without our I
 knowing it, high policy, for policy is
 only morality applied to civil life.
 Our duty to ourselves, like our poli
 cy, is to confound ours* Ives with the
 country from which we caunot secede
 without weakening it, and, consequent-1
 ly, notmuthout crime; the country,
 which had greater call for suc
 cor? for illumination, and for energy,
 would never pardon us for not having
 offered so much of them in our sta
 tion we may possess. Let us not con
 stitute ourselves the helots of civiliza
 tion and of France; let us not, by a
 false political attitude, accept, let us
 not justify, that title of conquered,”
 which skilful enemies would impose on
 us to give themselves the odious rights
 of victory;—that title ttf conquered,
 for which some of us have the weak
 ness to honor ourselves! There were
 no conquered in France in the battle
 of July, except those who, in fact or
 in heart, betrayed the sworn law, to
 attack the country in her right and her
 repose, to overturn, institutions, and
 place at the mercy of a street row, a
 nation, a throne, Europe, and the age!
 We are not of such men! We re
 proved them beforehand at the lime,
 and afterwards: let us lament their
 blindness and their punishment, but nut
 adopt to ourselves the political repro
 bation wherewith we struck them be
 fore defeat, before posterity. They
 committed tbe fault, and we pay the
 penalty: we are neither the victors nor
 the vanquished; we are the victims of
 July! Let us know our true denomi
 nation, and let us make others know
 it; we are Frenchmen, and worthy of
 France. Let us unite our efforts to
 hers, to upraise her, to sustain her, to
 constitute, and to defend her: if she
 repulse us, let us sorrow ovR her, but
 let it not be said that we have aban
 doned her! Let us press into tbe ranks
 of her national militia, present our
 selves whenever there may be disinter
 ested service to be rendered! Let us
 not examine under what color or under
 what sign, but for whom and for what
 we are fighting! It is France and the*
 country; it is ever humanity! Honor-j
 ing all signs, all colors she unfurls, let
 us vote in the municipal councils! Let 1
 us vote in the departmental councils!!
 Let us, above all, vote in the electoral
 colleges! Let us not voluntarily close
 the door of political action, of election,
 by an evasion, or by as error. J
 Let us enter, if the door is open to
 us, into the assembly of the country's
 representatives; let os mount the tri
 bune with s convinced, loyal, and firm
 speech if the chamber lias no echoes
 for us, the country will have. The
 words of the people’s envoy go further
 and arc weightier than the voice of the
 writer: it is wknfe population, a
 whole province, a whole opinion, that
 speak bv this mouth. It has a mission
 to put forward, s political symbol; to
 protest in fhe ju uae of a tralb, or of an
 interest. The tnbune is tbe ctmir ot
 S popular truth; the words w inch fob
 from it are reality and life. Let as as
 cend it, then! Let us ascend it, not
 to speak more audibly to passions
 which call on us to flatter them, and
 which pay out baseness with applause;
 not to csre** with vain regret*, nor to
 envaaom with bitter antipathies; net to
 recriminate agstart a past that belong*
 ho nobudv; wot ta plant aatbuulw* ia
 the embarrassed way of a power that
 has fop many *by**s under it* font;
 not even to dissertate like the sopbwU

 political d.gma. the law, di»’nu or so-
cial, tba source of leritimuy of gov
 ernment; the rights of a family over a
 people, or of a people over a family.
 Let us leave such things to moments ol
 peace and vain disputation, and their
 solution to times and deeds, which alone
 can resolve them. Let us sneak there
 of the present and the future; let us
 establish there and prolific theo
 ries of rights and liberty; let os infuse
 our religious, moral, progressive sen
 timents into the laws; let us there re
 call to human nature what she owes to
 herself,what she owes to the generation
 she is pregnant with; let us make her
 comprehend the epoch before her eyes,
 and which she sees not; let us show
 her this age, opened for great things,
 and yet ready to precifiCtate itself into
 vain quarrels of worths and persons,
 into political inanities, inlo sterile wars,
 into national ruin, into European ea
 amities, if she do not seise it imme
 diately, if she does not gather the fruit
 ripe to-day, to-morrow rotten! Let us
 descend thence to the interests of the
 day; let us help tho democracy to or
 ganize itself, to live; let us give it
 guides, make it laws, create morals for
 it, For it alone is all the future of the
 world; especially let us teach it, that
 it cannot live without form, that the
 form of all political reality is a govern
 ment; that the life of every regular
 government is a strong and true exec
 utive that this executive cannot be the j
 mobile expression of inconstant fac
 tions, the perpetual work of popular.
 caprice; that it wants root in the soil
 to resist tempests; that the roots arc
 organic laws, which inu9t attach it to
 the country, and communicate to its
 limbs the sap which it will there ex
 tract. Let us remind it, that to be a
 free people, it does not suffice to write
 the word liberty on the frontispiece of
 its government; but that it must stamp
 it on the very foundations; aud, “from
 turret to foundntion-stone,” fabricate of
 the social edifice an harmonious whole
 of rights, duties, discussion, election
 and liberty. Above all, let us prove to
 it, that it should be just, and that the
 right of all only lives in the right of
 each. Despotism can subsist on a
 false base, because it depends on force;
 liberty cannot, because she relies on
 ustice. If the right of a single one is
 ivantiug in its conditions, its foundation
 links, and it crumbles to atoms.
 Let us often raise the looks of men,
 aur thought and our voice, towards
 that regulating Power from whom flow,
 according to Plato and our gospel, jus
 tice, the laws, and liberty; who alone
 knows to extract good from evil; who
 holds in His hands the reigns of em
 pires, and shakes them often rudely
 and with violence, to arouse mankind
 from their slumbers, and remind them
 that they must walk in the road of their
 divine destiny toward light and virtue;
 that impulse of human nature towards
 aeaven is not in fractions—it is an in
 aer force, it is the faith of humanity in
 progress. Let us recall to ourselves
 this force and this faith, in times of
 doubt and trial; let us put trust in that
 Providence whose eyes overlook not
 ige nor day; let us do good, tell truth,
 leek the right, and wait.
 Adieu, sir; whilst useless to my
 country, I am going to seek the vestiges
 »f history, the monuments of Christian
 regeneration, and the distant echo of
 profane or sacred poesy in the sands of
 Egypt, on the ruins of Palmyra, or at
 :he tomb of David. May you not as
 iist at new ruins, nor prepare for his
 tory the funeral pages of a people,
 which still bears in itself centuries of
 Life, prosperity, and glory! May the
 generous hearts and spirits which this
 earth produces in each generation,
 without ever exhausting her supply of
 genius aud virtue, extinguish their tri
 vial discussions in the sense of their
 common duty, and guard that future of
 France, which France alone can keep
 or do away with! That is the wish of
 the most devoted of her sons, who only
 quits her for a day, because she does
 not require him; whom she can sum
 mon at any hour, and who only thinks
 his thoughts or steps free while be can
 not better employ them for her, and do
 her service or honor otherwise.*

 Its framers and ratiiicrs held among
 them, six or seven hundred thousand
 slaves. Vet this .Constitution neithci
 abolished slavery, nor provided for U*
 f future abolishment, nor condemned it
 as a sin against God, man or liberty,
 nor lainentedcd it ms an fevil, nor ex
 pressed a desirre for its cessation, nor
 so much as mentioned it by name. It
 designedly avoids the honest use of the
 terms by which slaves, slavery and
 slaveholding havo ever been popularly
 designated.
 Neither did it abolish the abominable
 foreign slave trade, which was then in
 full career; hut actually profit h'Utd the
 abolition therof even by n nundinal!, for
 twenty years; without giving the slight
 est pledge that after the year HH the
 traffic should be suppressed.—Thus it
 sanctioned and pledged national pro
 tection to unmitigated piracy against
 humanity. It did all this without one
 solitary expression of shame, sorrow or
 compunction.
 It gave slaveholders a preponderating
 political weight in the election of Pres
 ident .and Vice President, and in the
 lower branch of the National Legisla
 ture, to the extent of three fifths of nil
 their slaves; whence has resulted o
 slave holding oligarchy in the gov-|
 ernmcnt,and innumerable evils to the
 country. It pledged all the citizens J
 of the United States to deliver up
 fugitive slaves on demand of persons
 claiming them under the laws ofa slave
 holding State, just as if they were act
 ual felons, w hereby thousands of unfor
 tunate people have been subjugated,
 not only to recapture, but to all manner
 of cruelties for the innocent act of try
 ing to obtain by peaceful flight their
 natural and inalienable rights.
 It pledged the whole natural force of
 purse and arms to protect slaveholders
 against domestic violence, though nat
 urally and wantonly provoked py out
 rage and inhumanity under the system
 of slavery. In this way U.S.Constitu
 tion clandestinely but effectually en
 dorsed the moral and republican char
 acter of slaveholders, held out a bounty
 of extra political power to the perpetra
 tors of new and aggravated outrages on
 the rights of man, installed the slave
 trade as a legitimate branch of national
 commerce for twenty years, cut olFthe
 slaves from all hope of deliverance
 either by flight or resistance, made the
 Federal government Jailer to the slave
 states, opened the door to a long series
 of slavocratic usurpations, and com
 pletely implicated the whole nation in the
 guilt of an institution which aggregates
 and involves all the wickedness which
 human beings can commit against one
 another or their Creator. All this is
 as clearly demonstrable as that two
 and two make four.
 Yet this Constitution was framed and
 adopted by a people professing unboun
 ded reverence for republican liberty and
 the natural rights of man. And it con
 tinues to be suported on oath or affirm
 ation by such a people, thus far to the
 triumphant march, extension and con
 solidation of slavery.
 That it may be seen how jealously
 this Constitution guards the £&gt;irty ofi
 Republicanism agatnst the tyranny off
 Jdonarchy and the insidious encroach
 ments of foreign influence, read the fol
 lowing article:
 “If any citizen of the United States
 shaH accept, claim, receive or retain 1
 any title of nobility or honor, or shall,'
 without the consent of Congress, accept
 and retain any present, pension, office
 or emolument of any kind whatsoever,
 from any emperor, king, prince, or for
 eign power, such person shall cease to
 he a citizen of the United States, and
 shall be incapable of holding any office
 of trust or profit under them, or either
 of them.**
 Thus it appears that if*a citizen of
 the United States, without a special act
 of indulgence from Congress, should
 accept of a cane, or a tin medal, or a
 red ribbon from 4tueen Victoria, he
 would forfeit all the rights and hon
 ors of citizenship, lie could neither
 vote nor hold office. He would reader
 himself uuworthy of membership in the
 civil society of this liberty-loving Re
 public. But he may hold 1000 slaves not
 only without reproach, but with addi
 tional political influence,and with the so

 run away from him, tha/ shall be de

 In Lothing is Ihe inequality of tb

 strikingly or painiiilly than in the simil
 compensation usually paid tor temah
 Ulnir. Female* are often required 1
 i don loan's day's work with the needle
 but because they nre female*. they an
 only allowed one quarter of a man'
 wages. In fact thousands of womei

 it does not sustain it, for in a few year
 they die. Others arc dri\ en by want

 comfortably and preserve fteaith.

 common appeal to the patriotism of the
 common people. But all this happens
 t&lt;&gt; be, practically an.l in effect, for man.
 Woman has never yet attained to rights
 of citizenship, and is excluded from
 legislation, only so far us penal statutes
 are concerned, which punish her for
 the very sins she is absolutely compell
 ed to commit.
 Something mint be done for our work
 ing-women. They are the very salt of
 this earth why arc they treated like
 outcasts and vagabonds They are
 virtuous and industrious they are wil
 ling to earn all they need why are
 they obliged to both work and starve
 Alas, man, inhuman and sordid, has
 become callous-hearted and soul-im
 bruted with the inordinate spirit ofguir,
 and will sacritice a hundred of thu
 bodies and souls of unoffending and in
 nocent females, to add a few more dol
 lars to his already enormous profits.
 We believe this subject is a proper one
 for legislation and any man guilty of
 paying less than a living compensation
 for work, is a proper subject for fin*
 and imprisonment.— JY*. Y. Organ.
 Women. —The disadvantages under
 which women meet the trial* and diffi
 culties of life, has of late met the atten
 tion of philanthropist* in a degree much
 greater than formerly. A* a nation
 advances in civilization, woman as
 sumes a more important part in the
 great drama of life, and many efforts
 are now in the course of aetionto place
 her where she of right ought to be, on a
 perfeot equality with man. Our neigh
 bor of the Saturday Visiter is doing her
 share in her own sphere to aid in thi*
 emancipation of her sex; other women
 are working for the san:c end, by differ
 ent means.
 Our attention was directed- to thin
 subject by a paragraph in the Philadel
 phia Times, from which we learn, that
 the young woman whose attendance
 upon a course of inedieni lectures was
 noticed by us some month* since, is
 now a resident assistant Physician in
 the Almshouse .in that city, that she
 visits the several wards, and perform*
 all the duties incumbent upon her in a
 highly creditable manner.
 We are rejoiced at the success of
 this pioneer in the cause of Woman’*
 emancipation; and trust that her effort
 to establish a College lor the instruc
 tion of her own sex in the science of
 medicine, may be properly appreciated,
 and enjoy all the prosperity such noble
 exertions would seem to deserve.—

 Tbo following refers to the repre
 sentative of South Carolina, in the late
 Democratic Convention, (says tbo
 Young America,) who was allowed to
 cast the full vote of the State:
 A correspondent of the Herald, writ
 ing from Baltimore, says:
 "John Van Burcn will have tha
 chivalrous (Jen. Commander offer him
 with a long pole, as soon as lib Park
 speech reaches South Carolina. He
 touched the Gene rat on a sore point
 when he called him Gen. Cat-and
 ninr-tails,” though probably without
 knowing that lie was doing so, which i
 will endeavor to explain. Although
 the general is a »maU planter now, ho
 was until recently an overseer on cot
 ton plantations. The lest situation of
 this kind he held, he lost by the too free
 use of the "ca'-siul-niue-tails,” on the
 bai e back of one of hi* employer's fe
 male slave*. .)t appear* that he order
 ed one ot the field hands to wash and
 do up his linen, which she being in-sx
 pert at, did not do up to im satisfaction.
 He accordingly took her out in the field
 and cwt her most unmercifully with the
 cat-atid-niim-taiU; indeed, so brutal was
 the whipping, that lie wax immediately
 discharged. He ihcu commenced a
 suit against the planter for bat salary
 for the remainder of the year, and for
 the value of the “hog and hominy,” he
 wouldhave eaten *1 that tune. The
 case was called the **cat-and'nine-t«il■
 ease, and the jury gave him bis salary,
 hut refused to award huu the value ol
 the hog *fid hominy.
