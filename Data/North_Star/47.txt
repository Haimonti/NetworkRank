 Canandaigua, March 4th, 1948.
 Fuikxd Douglass :—I was very much in
 terested in looking orer the last number of the
 Star, in tbe address to tbe Christians of Roch
 ester, and your strictures on Revivals. Per
 haps you would be interested in hearing that
 we have protracted meetings in the various
 pro-slavery churehes in this village; and 1
 think this week, it is called a revival Souls
 born into the Kingdom." You must not in
 fer, that we are not a religious people, be
 cause tbe advocates of tbe suffering slave were
 shut out of every maetiug-houae in this place.
 Almost our whole population are members ol
 the church and almost ever winter, special
 efforts are made to gather the rising genera
 tion into the Aik of Safety." Yet lam in
 clined to think, this revival was commenced so
 late in the season, that few will be gathered.
 Canandaigua, is t very religious place.—
 Piety is fashionable, and few are so short
 sighted, as to their Interest to remain long one
 of the 4i £okL” The praises of God arc echoed
 back from the walls of the sanctuary, on each
 returning Sabbath. The condition of the poor
 heathen on the other continent, is well re
 membered. Weekly prayers are put forth in
 their behalf; and money is poured forth freely
 to convert them from the error of their opin
 ions. But heathens ia America, heathens
 that are made such by tbs wicked and ungod
 ly laws of tills professedly Christian land, and
 whose members are increasing at the rate of
 100,COO per year; tli.-ir case must pot be
 mentioned, and rather than be annoyed with
 such an uupic uwuil topic, the churciies of this
 village have excomoauuicaiod every Abolition
 ist from their communion. Their business is
 IP preach the gospel sod anvwafuk, and not
 meddle with such secular matters ns slavery.
 Thsy hive too mteh religion, to rebuke tbe
 wicked and cruel war with Mexico; toe much
 religion to put forth any well directed effort to
 stay the tide of intemperance, (hat now ap
 pears to be coming in like a flood; too much
 religion, to rebuke the system of caste and re
 spect of persona, by which the image of God
 in the person of the poor colored man, is flout
 ed and despised in the sanctuary. They have
 a higher mission. Souk must not have their
 attention turned off from the one thing need
 ful, by the S3culiar topics. To euetam aa un
 popular reform with them, would be tbe great
 est folly. The gospel is to do up tho whole
 work of the world's redemption why should
 they lose their .reputation by attacking any
 oue specific wrong?
 In revivals like the present, the all absorb
 ing interest is the love of souk; but how much
 real love for souls there is among die revaluta,
 I will illustrate by an incident: The Rev. T.,
 a great revivalist, who formerly preached for
 oie of the moat aristocratic and bitterly pro
 slavery churehes of this village, during the
 progress of a revival io addressed a
 young man of my acquaintance, as follows
 Dear H., how 1 love youreoul," throwing
 his arm around bis neck. H., replied, 44 Mr.
 T., I have lived with you several years ie
 aaandkfua, aad have mrt you several tunes
 every week on the side-walk, and yet you
 never appeared le know er notice me. 44 My
 soe* is do better than I am,” and tamed sway
 in disgust. Tbe mass Rev. was on terms ef
 intimacy with e respectable family by tbe
 name of J. About 1849 Mr. J., died insolv
 ent. His widow remarked to me some years
 after her husband's death, that Mr. T., used
 frequently to visit them when they were rich,
 but now that she was ltd! a poor widow he
 never called.
 The doctrine meet streooouelj insisted np
 on during tbeee seen re of awakening, ie the
 total depravity of men, A Rev. Doctor ef
 Divinity of yourrety, who peeehod here net
 many days ago, io Ms eodeavor to napraaa
 this doctrine upon his sofieoee, acknowledged
 hiois -lf to bo a devil. I quote hk language,

 Friind Douglass, —The following well
 known and favorite lines have long been
 familiar to moat of us; but h struck me, ix
 thinking of them, that they seemed to concca
 under their light and airy imagery, a dee)
 and too often neglected truth, which I ven
 tured to embody as below:
 THE FLOWER AND THE STAR.
 A Flower beheld a Star above,
 Aad longed to reach its airy love;
 Bat loafed ia vain. A dew-drop fell
 Into the soft aad fragrant cell;
 Aad then the War was imaged there,
 As if it dropped from upper air,
 Aad, gliding down from Heaven, bad come.
 To Sod on Earth a kindred home.
 May they not be read thus!
 A Spirit fused on Heaven above,
 Aad longed to centre there its lose;
 But longed in vain. This sonny world
 Still kept its skyward pinions farted;
 Earth's loves, aad joy s, aad circling ties.
 Would never let that Spirit rise.
 Until the dew of Sorrow fell
 Into its deep and secret cell;
 And then the Star of heavenly love
 Looked from its throne of light above,
 AnJ, backward, fast baptising wave
 Jts lustrous beams unruffled gave.

 the poetry of life.
 u Them is nothing ia life worth living far, bat the
 poetry of it.”—HaXLITT.
 Wc are all pods, in a measurein this
 prosaic age, unfortunately not enough so.
 There is such a grovelling and mind-debasing
 scramble after what are falsely called the
 refines of Hfe—the politics—the wealth—the
 possessions—and, in but too many cases, the
 bare work-and-eat vegetation, that the poetical
 and real existence is crushed out, cramped,
 strangled, under a superincumbent mass of
 antagonistic evils. Still, poetry ia there; and
 we sometimes, by its ever-active energy, con
 trive to render poetical, ia some way or other,
 those want sod nnfroitfoßest of subjects.
 The hooest politician (a turns nmturm that but
 rarely visits our planet,) sometimes, ia the
 height of Us partisan enthusiasm, imagines,
 that if his creed were adopted, all would go

 poetic picture of a happy aad prosperous
 people, governed by wise and ooaseteatinus
 rulers. The money-seeker, ia the midst of
 Ua cares, aad calculations, aad tricks for
