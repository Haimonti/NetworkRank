SABBATH.
 NUMBER TWO.
 To the Editors of the North Star:
 Gintuvu :—The subject ot my last let
 ter appeared naturally to divide nsell into two,
 parts —the causes which made it necessary to
 pa* such a resolution, and lac subject of the
 resolution itself. 1 have alrealy treated upon
 the necessity, 11 the present state of public
 .opinion, and the position t&gt;f the Church, of
 ■passing such a resolution, aid, 1 hope, suc
 ceeded in showing the importance of the mo
 tion. I shall nmv treat of the subject of lhe
 resolution itself —the Sabbath. 1 his is;
 thj more important just .vow, ns public iiueu-j
 lion appears to he directed to this point; two.
 meetings having' been held in this city, within
 the last, two weeks, lor the purpose iff adopt
 ing, ainunp other movcm *nts, measures for 1
 enforcing the better observance of this ordi
 nance of the Church. If we trace this insti-j
 tuiiuii as fir hack as we are able, we shall;
 find it first mentioned in the account of the;
 ■creation given by M &gt;s?a to the liiidre.i of,
 Israel, as the foundation of toe law. Moses
 says
 And God blessed the seventh day, and
 sanctified it, because in it lie had rested from
 alj ilia works which God created ami made.
 t T :wn tins circumstance, Moses founded the
 severe, but necessary, institution of the Sab- j
 hath. (Exodus xwi, 11-17.) Severe though
 it was, it was, nevertheless, just, because
 nccC'Sary for the purposft which its great;
 Author had in view—the perfection and ulti-,
 mate happiness of the human race. When
 we consider the extensive operation of this j
 principle in the Mosaic polity, the minuteness
 of its details, and the severity of the punish- j
 ments attending its infraction, we cease to
 wonder that the Jews, after their return from
 ■captivity, should regard it with a kind ol
 superstitious reverence, almost amounting to
 awe. It was this extreme feeling of dread,
 after the tifrrible judgments which they had
 undergone for their departure from the insti
 tutions of Moses, which toroed them under all i
 their conquerers, and under all circumstances,
 to agitate for the enjoyment of their own laws
 and customs. This constant agitation and
 determined maintenance of Jewish
 ■chiefly under the Roman empire, first brought
 the Sabbath into general note and, no doubt,;
 finally caused the adoption of what has been;
 technically called the “Christian Sabbath.’
 Very early after the Jews returned from Bab
 ylon, it became customary for them to assem
 ble on the Sabbath day for the purpose of.
 Tending and hearing the law; and when the
 Christian religion was introduced, they still re- j
 mamed zealous of the law; (Acts xxi, 20-21;) j
 and, no doubt, kept the Sabbath nearly as
 strictly as they had previously done. And,
 although the docilities of Christ and his aj'os
 ties have been so long extant, and arc pretty
 conclusive upon the subject, it docs not ap
 pear, at present, to be rightly understood.
 When Jes us Christ commenced his ministry,
 the Pharisee* of that day found great fault
 with him and his disciples, for not kecpii g the 1
 Sabbath so strictly as th y were in the habit
 of doing. Bat he tola them, that they were
 altogether mistaken in regard to this mutter;!
 that it was not only 44 lawful to do good on
 the Sabbath day,” but even works of gomrnon
 necessity were lawful; that the Pharisees
 themselves, while they complained*of him
 healing the sick, would do anything that
 tended to the preservation of their own cattle.
 Thus, it being necessary that ins disciples
 should eat. made it also lawful to gather tin
 «eoru on the Sabbath day, that they might eat.
 Ho showed them, that even David, upon a
 •case o* necessity, had entered mto the house
 of God,” and lad eaten the shew bread,”
 and bad given to tlswe who were with him,
 which was equally unlawful, and could only
 e justified by the necessity of the case. Now,
 gentlemen, I ask the Pharisees of the present
 day. if it is not e pally necessary that tc should
 m-' t, to agitate for the freedom of th/' oppressed
 and down-trodden stave, on the only day in the
 week whSi the mass of the people are at lib
 erty to h. ar, even if it be the Sabbath 1 But
 these were nut the only case* of Sabbath
 breaking winch the Savior showed them, that
 were habitually occurring before their eves,
 and apparently wnkcut observation. The
 priests were constantly in the hab.t of dcse
 cratmg the Sabbath, and wete blameless.”
 They were obliged to hi fringe one part .if the
 law that they might be able to keep another
 entire. But Jesus told us, that Jhe Sab r
 was marie for man, and not roan lor the Sab
 bath.” If we an* to keep the SaMiath ac
 cording to the traditiois of the Pharisees
 (of tire present day) lustead of follow log the
 instructions of the Saviour, ought they not U&gt;

 TV INTER!
 Tkr sullen giant is upon ua, breathing
 hoar-frost from his nostrils, binding up the
 streams, and lakes, and rivers, in hw icy
 chains —throwing Ins snowy mantle over the
 bare and lifeless fields—banging icicles from
 our house caves, and drawing all manner ol
 f.uitastic figures upon our windows. It is the
 season of death and sterility of dark dreary
 nights and cold, snowy, frosty days. The
 summer-birds have foisakcn us, for a sunnier!
 clime and warmer skies and instead of their
 thrilling melody, wc now hear only the dis
 mal moanings of the w ind among the leafless
 branches, as if mourning over their death and
 desolateness while our every footstep falls
 soft and noiselessly, as if we trod w ith rever
 ential awe the chamber where lie the remains
 of deceased Nature.
 Winter! There is beauty in Winter. Stern,
 and sullen as he generally is, there is yet^an;
 occasional gleam in his countenance, as he:
 smiles upon us, in the clear sunlight of a;
 frosty morning, when the snow glistens and:
 sparkles with diamond brightness, and crisps,
 beneath the tread, —blinding ihe eyes with)
 excess of brilliancy; and still rooro, in the.
 pale moonlight, when wc sec as it were an
 innumerable host ot glow-worms, twinkling!
 and sparkling all around. How beautifully;
 graceful is the snow-drift, spread out in gentle
 curves and slopes by the toad-side, white, and
 pure, and spotless! and the snow flakes, as!
 they fill soft and gently from the clouds, how
 beautiful are they! Yes; even ia Winter,;
 every o:ii may discern graces innumerable, if;
 he would only go forth with a pare soul and a.
 cl ar eye, 10 look for them.
 Winter! What a host of pleasurable recol-;
 lections doss thv rough old voice conjure up.
 It is the time of social meetings and friendly
 gatherings. and feasts—of sleigh-riding and
 4easure-*eaking, in buffalo-ski us and com-j
 for table overcoats! With all thy harsh ex-i
 terior thou surely hast a warm heart; and we
 will try to give then as friendly a greeting as
 if thou hadst a more polished and gentle ex
 terior; vet it may be well to remind thee of
 the old proverb, that Short visits make long
 friends.”
 Winter! How the poor and friendless dread j
 thy approach! How they shrink and cower
 beneath thy icy touch, as they cluster around
 a cheerless hearth, or roam, iu scanty cover
 ing, beneath!thy inclement skies! Uis the
 season that Heaven sends, for the exercise ofj
 benevolence. Ye. on whom he has showered i
 down plentifully of the good things of this
 life, in the midst of your social meetings and,;
 pleasure feasts, thinjc of the destitute, who I
 crouch at your gates in tattered penury, or;
 starve at home in sullen wretchedness. Give!
 of your abundance, to supply a portion of their
 wants. Stretch forth the brotherly hand of
 eharitv. Remember that you are but stew'-;
 ards of the gifts of Heaven feed the hungry; j
 clothe the naked cheer the heart of the dis
 consolate; give free scope to vour benevolent
 nature let your love flow out to all. If you
 know any to be vicious, pity their wretched
 ness, while you hate their vice; relieve their
 wants, while you reprove their iniquity.—
 Speak to them kindly quench not within
 their souls the small spark of humanity that
 still faintly glimmers there; for the more
 feebly the fire burns, the more gently, if you
 wish it to become bright, and warm, and
 vigorous, must you fan tbs flame. And thus,
 will you prove that you are really devout and
 religious for, as lias been truly said—
 He prayetli best who loveth best
 All tilings lwali great am) uuull;
 For the dear Go 1 t!»at loveth us,
 He ma ie and loveth all.”
 And tliosa who so do will themselves also rc-j
 ceivc a blessing.
 The quality of merry is not straine
 It dffippeth, as the gentle rain from heaven,
 Upon the earth beneath. It is tw ice bleaa’t!—
 It blcsseti) la.n tliat gives and lain dial takes.”
 Winter! llow-apt an emblem of the de
 praved mind! The avenues to the human
 heart are s.-aled up by indulgence in vice; i
 the eyes ot' the understanding become dull
 and cloudy in its heavy atmosphere: and the
 gree t summer leaves of love are rudely torn
 away by the fitful blasts of its feverish ex
 citement. The profligate—the drunkard—
 the money-lover! Oh, how little summer is
 there in their souls! The dreary winter-cold
 of selfishness re gus there paramount, pro
 ducing no sweet fruits of love—no gre m
 1 leaves of charity—no genial showers of God
 like benevolence. How dead and barren all!
 how dry and w orthless. fit for destruction!
 Winter! To the rich savannahs of the
 South no Winter s *as»n conics. There the
 sun ever shines on verdant fields and luxuriant
 foliage; and frost and snow scarce find a
 resting-place, llut a Winter of the soul,
 more t. ruble arid enduring than the Winter
 of Greenland, reigns there; a monster nu
 quitv prevails there a Heaven-insulting wn
 wi Id* iu iron sceptre over those sunny
 regions, chasing away from them, amidst
 isisuit and ignominy, nil that elevates and
 etmoid-s mm. The sio of slaveholdmg lias
 t litre frown up all the genial springs of Uie
 Haul m ice-hand* of pride and a Ifit-hnew; it
 has thrown over the understanding thick,
 heavy mantle of prejudice; and the conscience

 s chilling frosts of a wintry indifference to the
 sufferings of oppressed humanity. Oh, what

 TIIE OHIO BLACK LAWS.
 The law-making party in Ohio (the Whig)
 claim to be the true friend* of our race, yet
 will not repeal the odious Black Laws, in
 themselves infamous enough to disgrace any
 nation. On December 6th, notice was gtven
 of an iutenuon to bring in a repeal bill; but
 little can be hoped in regard to its passage.
 Many of the influential members of both
 branches of the Legislature, say that tt is out
 of their power until after the Presidential
 election. One member declared, that if the
 Black Laws are to be repealed, he would kav
 the State. The bill has, however, been re
 ferred to a select committee. Your readers
 shall be informed of the action taken.

 Dear Friend Douglass Events do hap
 p3n which ought to be told to expose the utter
 shamelessness of their authors. I hate not
 the vaniiy, lioweveT, to suppose that I can
 chronicle them in such a manner as to interest
 your readers. Ido often wish that I had the
 power of giving vent to my indignation, when j
 I hare the misfortune to witness what I did j
 yesterday, at Northville, in Uus county.
 A Locofoco ex-judge and a Whig Presby- j
 tcrian deacon were in conversation, on the
 subject of the Mexican war. The deacou ex-
 pressed the opinion, unqualifiedly, that the
 war was justifiable on the part of the United j
 States; and he thought that our “national
 honor required that ice should prosecute it
 vigorously, until wc compel tha Mexicans to
 pay the expenses of it, and give us an hon*
 orabk pact. 1
 Of course, the ex-functionary of state sub
 scribed to all this, and said, further, that we
 ought to push the matter through, right of
 wrong.”
 The church where this patriotic deacon at
 tends was built new last year, and dedicated
 to the worship of God and to be kept fer
 that purpose only and, consequently, is not i
 opened to the friends of the slave. 1
 This fact is one of a thousand which show
 that on ihe chuich rests the responsibility of
 the iniquities of the land. Let her rottenness
 je exposed, sod let her go down to posterity.

 Detroit, January 9, 1848.
 Messrs. Douglass Del any
 Dear Friends —-The first number of the
 North Star has been received. We are
 exceedingly pleased with it. Enclosed $2
 is for one year's subscription. You had better
 adhere to the cash system it will save labor,
 and prevent embarrassment.
 A brief synopsis of matters and things here
 may not be uninteresting.
 For some weeks past, great effort* have
 b?en made to enlist and equip a regiment of
 Michigan Boys for Mexico. Six companies j
 marched recently—all young men, in prime
 life. Many were in teajs, and all looked
 sad. Last summer, Captain Mcßeynolds left
 here with 104 young men for the Halls of the
 Montezuma*. The Captain returned a few
 days since, wounded and, I understand, re
 ports only 34 of his men alive, and 17 fit for
 duty. Comment is unnecessary. What a
 sad—what a diabolical thing is war!
 Our legislature, at its last session, abolished
 the Death Penalty. The past year has been
 unusually prolific in murders. A few months
 since, a man near Niles, in the western part
 of the State, was shot down, robbed, and his
 body left to rot in the woods. Not long since,
 a colored man, in this city, had hi* brains beat
 out, while in his own bed, by a drunken
 rowdy. On Christmas eve, at Pontiac, an
 altercation took place between two men one
 stabbed the other, and he died next day. Last
 Saturday evening, in the shadow of a Chris
 tian church, in the most respectable part of
 the city, a young man was stabbed to the
 heart, and, without a groan, fell down a
 corpse. 1 was well acquainted with him. He
 was a native of Germany; and a very indus
 trious and worthy young man. His murderer
 was from the same country. These terrible
 murders have thrown the city into consterna
 tion and we bid fair to rival New Orleans.
 Many think these outbreaks of passion and
 revenge have been occasioned by abrogat
 ing the death penalty and the legislature
 will be flooded w ith petitions to reinstate it.
 We shall soon have one of the be* rail
 roads in the country, and one of the large*
 depots on the continent. It I* 880 fleet long,
 by 100 fleet wide built of bnek, and timbered
 in the strongest manner. The Boston Com
 panv, who purchased this road from the j
 State, have infused new life into the whole
 concern, and are rapidly pushing it to New
 Buffalo, its terminus oil Luke Michigan.— i
 There is one feature in die operations of this
 company worthy of commendation. If any 1
 of their servants or laborers are by
 accident, they do, not stop their wages and
 discharge them, but they receive their usual j
 pay until fit for doty. Our city costumes to
