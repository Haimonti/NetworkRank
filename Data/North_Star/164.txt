 I lu; earth is the great reservoir of
 electricity, from which the atmosphere
 i and clouds receive their portion of this
 fluid. It is durtng th** process of eva
 poration that it is principally excited,
 and silently conveyed to the regions
 above; and also during the condensa
 tion ‘&gt;f this same vapor, the giand and
 terrific 'phenomena of thunder and light-
 I ning are made manifest to our senses.
 In order to form a correct estimate
 of the immen-c power of this ng&lt; ut
 ,in the production of electricity, we
 must bring to our view the quantity of
 water evaporated from the surface of
 the earth, and also the amount of elec
 tricity that may be developed from a
 single grain of this liquid. According
 to the calculation of Cavailo, about
 five thou and two hundred and eighty
 million tons of water are probably
 evaporated from the Mediterranean sea
 in a single summer’s day. IV) obtain
 some idea of the vast volume of water
 thus daily taken up by the thirsty
 heavens, let us compare it with some
 thing rendered more apparent than this
 j invisible process. President Dwight
 land Professor Darby have both csti
 j mated the quantity of water precipitated
 over the Falls of Niagara at more than
 eleven million tons per hour. Vet all
 the water passing over the cataract in
 twenty days would amount only to that
 ascending from the Mediterranean in
 one day. More recent estimates make
 the mean evaporation from the whole
 earth as equal to a column of thirty-five
 inches from even' inch of its surface in
 a year, which gives ninety-four thou
 sand four hundr&lt; d and lilty cubic miles
 as the quantity annually circulating
 through the atm sphere. .Thus we see
 the magnificent scale on which the
 great machine works.
 I Dr. Furradav ha shown that a single
 drop of water contains as much elec
 tricity as an ordinary lla.-h ii. bluing
 —enough at lea t to destroy the life ot
 -an elephant. Tims the little dew-drop,
 from which the poet lias th rived such
 sweet images, may suggest to us ideas
 of a more sublime nature.

 DEATH NOT A PAIM’i'L FHOFESS.
 We think that most persons have
 been led to regard thing as a more
 i pamtul change than it generally is;
 first, because they have found, by what
 they experienced in themselves and ob
 served in others, that sentient beings
 often struggle when in distress; hence
 struggling to them is a sign, an invaria
 ble sign, of distress. Muscular action
 i and consciousness arc two distinct
 I things, often existing separately, anu we
 J have ahum! tnt reason to believe that in
 i a great porti &gt;n of the cases those strug
 i gles ol a d lug man winch arc so d»s
 trussing to behold, areas entirely inde
 pendent of cunsciousm ss as the sliug-
 I gles of an d ully decapitated h wl. A
 second rea-&gt;n whv mi ii are led to re
 gard dying as a very painful change, is
 because men often endure great pain
 without dxing, and forgetting that hke
 eau-e prove bke diets enlv under sim
 ilar circunstaace.j, u.cy inter tout Ine

 r pain. Put the pains of deatii are
 mtii u less than m&lt;-t persons have been
 led to believe, and we doubt not titat
 manv ncr.-mns who h\o to the age ol
 puberty, undergo tenfold more misery
 than they wounl d,d t!te\ understand
 correct views ronceinitig the change.
 In ail cases ot dying the ii.divliiu.il suf

 life without immediately affecting the

 Tin* rapid strides of the cholera
 are uow a subject of daily attention. If
 is advancing precisely i:i the same di
 rection as in 1632, and it has been no
 ticed that the satno influenza which
 prevailed a few months ago, and a fatal
 diarrhoea now prevalent, are precursors
 similar to those by which the disease
 was then heralded. It has already
 spread as far west as Riga, Narva and
 and Revel in Russia, and it is also
 raging southward in the Turkish do
 minions. The returns from St. Peters
 burg?! to the :2lth of July, give 17,712
 'cases, If), 13’-* deaths, 4uIS recoveries,
 and 19tvj remaining, so that the deaths
 already amount to 57 per cent. At
 Moscow there lias been 0751 cases,
 and 1303 deaths. At Odessa to the
 27t?i of June, t'2l cases, 33:2 deaths,
 2 55 recoveries, and 25ft remaining.
 In the South, at Jassy, in Moldavia,
 (Turkey in Europe,) tiie deaths lbr
 some time have been from 31) to 103 a
 day, and the total is said already to
 reach 10,003. At Balgat, a village
 near Ancona, nearly the whole popula
 tion lias perished. At Cairo the dis
 ease appeared suddenly on tiie loth of
 Ju'y. On that day 5 cases occurred,
 on the next IS, and the next 19. All
 these received medical aid and not one
 recovered, livery patient died in the
 course of a few hours. At Graditza,
 on the Danube, about 20 leagues from
 Belgrade, it Ims broken out with simi
 lar violence, and up to the last accounts
 ijo recoveries had taken place. One
 healthy woman, suddenly attacked, fell
 to the ground in live minutes. Two
 men in tiie next village, died almost in
 stanfaneously. At Belgrade a curious

 portnnt place in the politics of Germa

 the common run of royalty, as the cir
 camstances of his marriage evince.
 Many years ago, when traveliin;
 pilots by night, the Arch Duke came t&lt;
 the jio-4-office, where from some cause
 there wait no postilion to drive the ncx
 stage. The cause was urgent, and n
 substitute was to be obtained, when tin
 daughter of the post-master, an ex
 cecdittgly pretty girl, volunteered he
 services, and in a few moments hat
 donned the neat uniform of the post-boy
 in which she looked still more prcUj
 and more pique than in her own propel
 cestuinn.
 The Arch Duke, pleased with hei
 spirit, and enchanted with her beauty
 accepted her services, and site moun
 ted the horse and drove the slag
 handsomely and was of course well re
 warded. During the journey the Arc!
 Duke’s thoughts reverted to the pretty
 post-hoy, whose wit ami intelligence
 he found equal to- her spirit and beauty
 In a word he was in love with her, am
 in a short time afterwards he marricc
 her and made her a Duchess.
 Though adored by her husband, and
 admired by all who knew her, the
 daughter of the humble post-mastei
 was not always cordially recognized by
 the high born dames into whose circli
 she had been so romautically intro

 rope have altered the ease, and the
 very circumstance of her birth, enhan
