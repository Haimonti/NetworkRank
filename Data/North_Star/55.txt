 WHAT THE WORLD THINKS.
 It is an old saying, hilt more false than it is
 old, that What everybody says, must be
 true.” This everybody has often been most
 cggrcgiously mistaken. Kverylwdy is a very
 dull and untouchable monster, much more
 ready to act than to think, and that blunders
 along, always attempting to do something,
 but as oft on doing wrong as the reverse.
 Everybody, however, is more to Ire pitied
 than blum;d. lie means, for the most part,
 to do right—he tries to do right; and when
 lie is doing the greatest wickedness, will
 sum 'li nes even imagine that he is doing God
 •‘•■rviet. The worst trait in the character of
 everybody is, that he stops his cars against
 the words of those who would instruct him.
 He says, I don't want to hear you w hat
 you s.iv is fils I don't know what it is, but
 I know it is falsa. You are a fool—you are
 a fanatic—you are mad f
 This is melancholy, and vet it is in some
 Hsur.; useful it is one of the means hy
 which truth is tested. Some men are fools
 —some nr f matins—some are mad. Every
 man is so, more or less, in the opinion of his
 neighbor. One man holds certain opinions,
 and a neighbor who does not hold the same,
 calls him a fanatic and perhaps that fanatic
 thinks the other a fool. .Said one maniac to
 another, looking through tiic window of the
 cu id house—“ See those mad people outside
 Th -v think we are mad They arc all mad
 —we are not.”
 There is a picture of I)a Caus, the French
 discoverer of steam power, which I can never
 contemplate without emotion. Treated as a
 in imae, he is exhibiting the title of his work,
 D -s h.fos do In apeur.) from the grating
 &lt;&gt;f his prison. There are a number of people
 around, who are laughing and hooting t
 hi ii. The Marquis of Worcester, who w s
 engaged in similar pursuits, is one, of the on
 lookers. lie listens to what De Caus has to
 sav, am) in an off-hand manner, remarks,
 There may be something in it.” The
 world, in the end, always comes to see its
 error, as it has done in this case.
 It would almost seem that the world lias
 hated its prophets and teachers. Jeremiah,
 for prophesying the truth against his people,
 is let down into a dungeon where there is no
 water, hut mire; “so Jeremialwsunk in the
 mire.” Him of Nazareth \U3 called mad,
 and killed. Paul of Tarsus was called a
 babbler, and killed; and so on, through
 sacred and profane history, down to the pre
 sent day, the world has always endeavored to
 stop the mouths of its teachers. All this, of
 course, lias no effect upon ths man who has
 any truth to communicate. It is not of the
 slightest consequence to him whether the
 world calls him a fool, a fanatic, or a mad
 man. O.ie or other of these, or a similarly
 opprobrious epithet, he must but be called.
 But it moves him not. The truth is all to
 him everything else is nothing. He is by
 no means careful to make friends with the
 world for the world will not be on friendly
 terms with him, unless he will tolerate its
 errors. This he w ill not consent to do. Truth
 is utterly intolerant. It can make no com
 promise. There are no such words as expe
 diency, policy, compromise, in the vocabulary
 of Truth. It ceases to be Truth, as soon as
 it consents to join hands with Error. As
 soon as it docs so, it becomes a mixture of
 truth and falsehood. So with the man who
 lias discovered the truth —to whom it has
 become a reality. Everything else must
 give way to this. -With Jaither, lie aavs, 1
 can do no other.” He rests his foot firmly
 on that rock, and unshaken, unseduced, un
 terrified,” remains there immovable.
 Our own day is not without its manifesta
 tions of this spirit. And probably it arises
 out of the fart, that it is much more easy to
 call names, than to reason. Almost any one,
 with the help of a dictionary, can find a hard
 word to cast at those who take the liberty to
 differ from him. But, after all, it may not
 mean much. The hardest word m the dic
 tionary docs not mean much, it only means,
 when spoken of a person or thing, that it is
 the term which he who applies it, considers
 applicable—sometimes not even so much as
 that. The man who savs it may possibly not
 be any more infallible than Uie man about
 whom it is said. You are an a*a,” said
 a loafer to his companion.-—“ You are an
 other,” he retorted. Whereupon, they went
 to fisting each jtiluir —a pretty conclusive
 proof that they ware both right, though the
 mare fact that the one said to of the other, did
I by no meym pro** it. JioriMo another ex.

 ADDRESS OF ANTI-SLAVERY WO.
 MEN OF WESTERN NEW YORK.
 Under a deep ami abiding impression of the
 duty we owe to God and our fellow beings,
 the Anti-Slavery women of Rochester feel
 constrained to continue to persevere in their
 ellorls for the oppressed and millering bond
 men who still remain toiling unrequited in the
 Southern prison house. We are frequently
 brought painfully to remcmlier that not only
 i-&gt; their labor wrested from them unremunera
 ted not only do they suffer from intense hun
 ger and cold; not only are the females, ova
 sisters, subjected to the cruel and passionate
 outrages of their tyrannical masters and over
 seers but there are daily instances of sun
 dering the doarest tics in nature, thus sepa
 rating them forever. And can w e expect any
 thing b-tter—can we look for benevolence or
 fine feelings from a system so foul and fiend
 ish as slavery! It would be unreasonable,
 because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
 good fruit.” Therefore, knowing that with
 out associative anion we cannot render effi
 cient aid to tliis holy cause, wj affectionately
 invite the co-operation of the citizens of Roch
 ester and the public generally. We ask them
 to bear in mind the injunctions of Jesus, “All
 things whatsoever ye would men should do to
 von, do ye even so to them,” Remember,
 also, the beautiful parable in which he call*
 our attention to the sick and to those who are
 in prison, and conclud es by the forcible asser
 tion, “Inasmuch as ye have done it looneofthe
 least of these, my brethren, ye have done it
 unto roe.” We feel assured all that have
 hearts to feel, ami are careful to attond to the
 monitions of conscience—all who are deter
 mined to live fur the good of our race, instead
 jof devoting all their time to their own per
 sonal ease—all who feel bound to improve the
 precious time allotted to theta here, by pio
 moting as much as possible the cause of truth
 and righteousness in the earth, will come for
 ward in the work oflaboringto banish forever
 the demon of slavery from our land; and in
 so doing, instead of an example of corruption
 and wickedness, we should be a light to the
 world.”
 J c hope no one will feel too poor, nor any
 too rich, to enlist in this holy cause. The
 1 Christian s influence, in whatever situation, is
 always salutary, and will certainly produce its
 good effects. e ask for the aid of men and
 of women we call on ths old and the
 j young, the farmer, the mechanic, and the
 j merchant. AN c ask all and every’ one to give
 us their help to devote what they can spare,
 either of money or of the frmtsof their la
 bor, to the work of restoring inen and women
 to themselves, to their manhood, to the rights
 j and blessings with which they were endowed
 j by our Creator.
 For this object, we propose holding a Fair
 in December next. We ask the finales in
 the adjoining towns and country around us, to
 get up sew ing circles, and prepare such arti
 cles as will lie most saleable, and to mme fnr
 -1 nisli tables, give us their company, and help
 us, not ouly to selling those things thus pre
 pared, but in convincing the public mind of
 the uecessily of our perseverance and fidelity
 and thus be helpers in hastening the day of
 emancipation. 3

 Paris Feb. 27.—Paris is this morning perfectly
 tranquil, and as much so as it lias been lor the last

 1 Royally is abolished,
 i The republic is proclaimed.

 I The army is being reorganised. The national

 propriety of immediately presenting t«
 the provisional government of the French

 tlte French people during and after the
 late revolution. The proceedings com
 menced by G. W. Irving, Esq., of Mas

 The recent political events which have fa

 in almost all parts of the continent of Kurop
 combined with the turbulent proceedings
 mobs which have para-led the streets of Lot

 during the course of the past week, have ha
 i an injurious effect upon the t-ade of this com
 try. All parlies engaged in innnufaclurin
 and commercial pursuits feel a distrust as t
 the permanency of the present order of thing
 in France. The transactions in alt kinds c
 produce have, therefore, notwithstanding th
 abundance of money out and the ens
 terms on which it can beobt tiueJ—been lim

 Likl vxd.—The excitement produced through
 out the entire country by tha news of the
 French revolution, has been most intense, ami
 particularly so in the south-east and west.—
 The corporations of Dublin and Kilkenny have
 already drawn up addresses to the Fiench peo
 ple, congratulatory of their success. In Cork,
 Drogliedi, Limerick, Clonmel, Hoscrea, Hor
 risokunj and other places, illtunimtions, bon
 fires, and rejoicings have taken plae and a
 general masting has bean convened, to be held
 in every parish in Irelmd, on the 17th of March,
 (St. Patrick's day). The citizens of Dublin
 will h ive a monster” meeting on the subject.
 The military in that now wear their side
 arms in the streets—a practice w hich has been
 dropped since the contemplated Clontarf mon
 ster meeting in 1844. Unusual activity pre
 vails at Dublin Castle, and the general officers
 are reported to have been consulted on divers
 serious matters by his excellency.
 A special meeting of the confederation was
 hold iu Dublin on the 9th inst., Mr. Crean, an
 ojierative, presiding. Resolutions, expressive
 of a desire to forget all differences, and to unile
 with all sectio n of rapealers, were brought for
 ward, and unanimously adopted. The rumor
 was prevalent in Dublin on the 9ih, that the
 privy council hail decided ou suppressing or
 preventing the demonstration throughout Ire
 land on tli a l/ih, but no pruclamatiou h ul been
 issued up to that day. It was, however, daily
 looked for.
 Several of the prisoners sentenced to death
 at the late special commissions in limerick,
 Clare, and Tipperary, hare been executed.—
 On tbs Ist lost., Henry and Philip Cody and
 .Michcal Louergan suffered at Clootnel, after a
 terrible scene, and amidst imprecations and
 curses.
 Sratx.—The news of the revolution in,
 Franca produced the deepest alarm at Madrid.
 Repeat'd conned* of ministers were held, and
 Queen Christina was so much effected by the
 news from Paris, that it was found necessary
 lu bleed her twice. The garrison of Madrm
 was kept under arms, the guards and seutiio
 were doubled, and it was said that an army of
 observation of 50,000 men was ordered to the j
 Pyrenees. There appears to be no doubt but
 that the details of the act fur suspending the
 constitution and creating a virtual dictatorship,,
 proposed by Narvaez, will be confirmed.
 A letter by tb* Cologne Gazette, dated,!
 Coblentz, Sd inst., says—“ The Duchess of*
 Oi leans amvod here last night with her two’
 sous, the Count de Paris and the Due de
 Chsrtres, aeeompamed by the Marquis of Mon

 P; SictkV.—latest advices fmm Naples stale
 that the king, once more viijating his solemn
 &gt;i word and promise, has earned fire and iht
 sword mlo the city of Messina, which has been
 V bombarded during forty-two hours by the my a!
 d troops. The Porto Franco is almost entirely
 •j hurijt down, causing, from the destruction ol
 i this entrepot alone, a loss of 10,000,000 francs.
 It is said that the Mcssincsc have attacked the
 citadel of that city, dnd taken it by assault. It
 was rumored at Marseilles that the king of Na
 ei pies had complied with the demands ol thc pete
 f pie of Sicily. Tlw ministry has resigned.
 JJararia. —On the 4th of March a serious
 movement lock place, 'IV people demanded
 the immediate convocation of the chambers,tin.
 liberty of the press, that judicial trials should
 bo public, that an electoral reform should b
 granted, and that the army should take an oath
 .I to observe the constitution. The king tefused
 I to convoke the chambers before the end of May.
 It was announced that the new minister,Prince
 I VVrode, had called out the troops, ami had
 i promised the king that they should lire upon
 j the people. The arsenal was attacked aliout 2
 I I o’clock by the people, and captured after a
 short engagement. More than 6,000 men,
 p armed with muskets, s thros, hatchets, lances,
 and halberds, marched against the royal pal
 i ace. Having arrived at the market place, the
 crowd met the troops; but neither the cuiras
 seis nor the troops of the line would charge
 when commanded to do so. Cries of The
 Republic forever,” were raised. At length
 the king yielded to the demands of the people.
 Prince Charles, tl»e King's brother, rode up
 to the crowd, amt assured them, on his word
 'of honor, th it the king had conscMited to
 convoke the che.ubers for the 10th of March,
 and that he granted all that the people de
 sired
 Italy —The Jesuits have already quitted
 the city of Turin. The journals of Turiufully
 appreciate the tendency of the French revolu*
 i turn, and are now encouraging the king to put
 himself at the head of the national forces, ami
 to endeavor to effect the salvation of Italy. Ai
 Alexandria, and throughout Piedmont, all the
 warlike preparations are complete. The Aus
 trian army is no longer an object of fear to the
 constitutional states of Italy. Advirea from
 Genoa announce the arrival of an American
 i squadron in that i»ort on the 3d of March.—
 Lombardy openly declare that they will not
 even pay the supplementary tax. All corre
 spondence between Lombardy and France
 prohibited. Letters from Rome of the 28th nil.
 state that the committee appointed by the pope
 to prepare the constitution was actively en
 gaged on that task. There are to be two
 chambers; the one composed of cardinals and
 clergymen, and the others of representatives ol
 t he people.
