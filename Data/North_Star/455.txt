 all others, is tb* l d*»iroctive to out in

 But. air, tl» ®°««««woo waa never intend
 ed to extend beyond what it plainly imports
 It gives to *l*re States no other privilege
 thao that of repteaentatioo agreeably to ilm
 number of their slaves. It imposes no obli
 gallon, whatever, upon the people of tbefre*
 .•State* to maintain the ••master's power ovei
 hta slave with our blood,” nor doeah impose
 upon Congress the duty “to protect slavery
 wherever oar dag floats.*' Nor can any mi
 terence, whatever, be drawn from this clause
 of the Constitution beyond it* plain arid obvt
 ous apportionment of representation and di
 rect taxation.
 In order toeatabliah the duty of this Gov
 ernment to sustain slavery we are referred to
 the obligation 1 upon os to ‘‘protect
 each of the States trom invasion, and against
 domestic violence."
 This provision extends to the free as well
 as to the slave States. History informs us
 that the rebellion in was the
 occasion o! its adopuoe. Mr. Madison in
 forms us that membeis from the slave States
 assured the Convention that they neither
 needed nor required any provision of the kind.
 But no man can mistake the object and de-'
 sign of this section NVe are bound to pro
 tect cv* y Slate from invasion. This piotec
 lectio.. is thrown around the State, including i
 all the people therein; the righteous and the
 wicked, the bead and the free, the black and

 Without inquiring who they are! The master
 found in arms is shot down precisely as the
 »!lvd ,hfl Insurgent slave is butchered
 with just as little ceremony as the insurgent
 master. Indeed we know of no distinction!
 in such case. Our troops have nothing to do
 pith slavery; their duty if. to quell t|ie vio-,
 fence. That dona, every slave'm the State j
 may walk off to Canada, in full view of our;
 army, and they possess neithei the right nor
 the constitutional power to interfere, oi in any
 manner to prevent their escape. But in case
 of invasion, or of insurrection, the power ot j
 {he Government in repsllmg the one or sup-j
 pressing the other is unlimited by the Consti-i
 tution. The whole physical power of the
 nation may then be brought into action for
 that purpose, and iI deemed necessary by the
 Executive, who is the commander of the
 army and navy, he may liberate every slave
 in such State for the purpose of saving the
 people qr of restoring peace. This is a pow
 er, however, lying behind {he lyonstituticn,
 based upon the right of self-defenco, upon
 {he duty of presetving {he Government. *»d
 existing only in time of foreign or of civil
 war.
 And now, Sir, I have examined what
 we so often hear called the ‘‘compromiaes of j
 ibeConstitution.” They consist entirely in:
 the privilege conceded to {he slave States, to
 continue the slave trade until 1*08; to pursue j
 and recapture their fugitive slaves; and to be
 allowed a representation in Congress propor-j
 honed to the number of their slaves. They
 have no further claims whatever tn favor of j
 slavery. Beyond these, we are bound to act
 fox freedom, for the political equality of all
 men, for the mwniamsnce of‘‘the rights or
 Jl to life and liberty.” Aside from these,!
 the people of these fiee States pusses* the
 clear and indisputblc right to be separated,!

 Wnulied to import slaves. But they went to
 Africa at their own peril. &gt;Ve furnished
 ifiem no protection. if. in attempting to

 that country, they were slain, all regarded
 their fate as roost just and righteous. W hen
 their victims were placed on shipboard, these
 dealers in human flesh looked not to thi*
 Government for protection. They depended
 upon phvsical force, upon chains gfld fetters
 the scourge and thumbscrew, the pistol and
 dagger for their safety, until they reached the
 ,uri.diction of the slave State to which they
 hutried their cargo. There the laws of such
 State threw its protection around them: and

 the matter’s aid in holding his vetira in sub-;

 ilsde expired in 1808, and the traffic vyas
 pencefbriti entirely iflterdicted. At the same
 note, Congress restricted the coastwise slave
 trade by imposing heavy penalties for trans
 porting slaves from one of our#wn sea-ports

 that occasion. He awed for adopting the
 resolutions. The others appear to hart been ab

 j j¥ f r y Southern Senator of both parties,
 and all Northern Democrats who voted gava
 their support in favor of the resolutions
 I his was in the year I*4o, and soon after that
 period, one of the Senators [Mr. Webster]
 who Jtd not rote on three resolutions, was
 called to preside over the State Department,
 under President Tyler. While he was gui
 ding the most important branch of the Exec
 utive duties, the case of the Creole occurred.
 1 hat ship sailed from Richmond, with a car
 go of slaves, in October, 1841; while on the
 high seas the slaves arose, asserted their
 right tc freedom, and slew one of the slave-
 *ancf guiding the ship to the lafand of
 New Providence, went on shore, and became
 entirely free. The piratical dealers, who
 professed to own the people thus restored to
 freedom, called upon the President to aid
 them in obtaining indemnity for their loss;
 and Mr. \V ebster was requested to carry out
 the doctrine fir which be Ind other Northern
 Senators had refused to vote. A statesman
 tired up and educated in New England, one
 who had long breathed the free air of ihe
 North, who had been taught the language ot
 freedom, condescended to become the agent
 ind solicitor of those who deal in human flesh
 ind to exert fiia o&amp;oial influence to maintain
 i commerce in the bodies ot rneu and wo&gt;
 men,
 The attention of the nation, however, was
 railed to these facts by resolutions presented
 n this body. The proceeding of the Execu
 tive was condemned by all. Not even slave-
 Holders were w illing to sustain the dootrine.
 The further prosecut.on of their ial'amous
 jlaun was given up. The State Department
 receded from its position; the celebrated reso*
 lotions which were intended to establish new
 principles in the law of nations, remain a
 lead letter upon the journal of the Senate.
 The owners of the slaves of the Creole have
 pocketed their loss; and the slaves themselves
 ire now most of them tlntiah subjects, and
 i few are freemen, residents of our fiee States
 Yet, air, these attempts of Mr. Calhonn, aid
 ed by Southern slaveholders, and of Mr. Web
 ster and President Tyler lo commit the na
 tion to the doctrines centended for by the gen
 tleman from Georgia, [Mr. Toombs,] are now
 quoted in both ends of the {Capitol to show

 jver our flag boats signal failure to
 sustain the doctrine, is couMaktly cited by
 slaveholders to demonstrate its correctness.
 The reasoning is of that absurd charactei
 which requires onlv to be staled to b« appre

 ced are not new. They have been ufter

 is bound to protect the master's right to th&lt;
 slave in the same manner that we ara nt
 hO protect him in tbe*enjoyment of other pro
 peny. Such was once the opinion of Eng
 lish jurists, but it was a darker age. Thi
 latest decision to that effect in the Engliel
 courts beats datp mo;e than a hundred years
 since., jn 1772, Eord Mansfield denied tin
 doctrine, and combated it with such argu
 ments as to set the matter forever ?i rest it
 the courts of Great Ejritam. From the com
 n.eneemem of the Revolution to this day w&lt;
 have refused to admit that slaves are property.
 This Government has always refused to pay
 f H{ slaves killed or lost in the public service.
 In 1816, Congress passed a law making com
 pensation for property lost oy destroyed in
 the service of Government. Pending the
 bill, a motion was made so to amend U as tc
 allow compensation for slaves killed or lost
 while in the public service, in the same man
 ner as the Ciovernmeot paid for other proper
 ly; but the amendment was rejected by a
 large majority, there being only thuty-twe
 members in favor of it. In 1828, the case ol
 "D’Auterive'’tane before Congtoss. The
 slave, hotse, au-4 the cart of the claimant
 were passed ;nto toe public service against
 his consent, on the day of battle at •New
 Orleans. His slave and horse were killed,
 and cart destroyed; and the owner called on
 Congress to make compensation. A hill
 was reported paying lot the horse and cart,
 but refusing to pay for the slave- The claim
 was of the strongest possible character. It
 was discussed some weeks, w hen it wa9 laid
 on the table, and has never been heard fiom
 since. In 1832, the case of Larche, of the
 same character, was rejeoted- In 1842, ano
 ther attempt wq» niade to induce Congress
 to pay lor slaves ’qsl in East Florida by the
 action of our troops in 1814, but the claim
 was rejected —only thirty-six members voting
 for it. During the last Congress, efforts
 were made to pass the bills to pay for slaves,
 but none of them succeeded, lit the 28th
 Congress, a bill to pay for a slavedost in the
 Florida way came id this body from the Sen
 ate Uw as committed to the Committee ol
 the Whole House. 1 was perfectly aware ol
 its character, and called the attention of my

 case without any beneficial effect.
