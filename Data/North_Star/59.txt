 I have just read Mr. Webster** speech on
 the I/o.ui Hill, delivered in the Senate Cham
 ber, March *23d. This great speech,” the
 Editor of the Tribune calls it. Great it
 tnay be, but it is withal a rich sjiociincn of the
 nnti'/vr not of the distant past, of Greek
 or Homan story, n«*r yet of the day* of joust
 and tournament. No, it docs not belong to
 the rhivalric age there is nothing of that in
 it. Hut yet we are reminded of days gone
 by, when it would have l&gt;een in lime, when it
 might have prevented, perhaps, much mis
 chief. Surely, the honorable Senator has
 heard of Gian Hills and increasing* of regu
 lar and volunteer forces Indore this; he has
 known all alnmt the folly and wickedness of
 this war for the acquisition of more territory,
 of a wider area of freedom.” Where has
 he been I—whv 1 —whv has not the oracle spoken
 Why, Daniel lias come to judgment 100 lnt&lt;
 The steed is stolen *tis of no us? to try to
 shut the door nmr. It's a pity, too, he should
 have been so easily discouraged.
 He says he made efforts, hv applying to
 distinguished gentlemen, before Texas was
 annexed, to devise a plan to warn the people
 the danger, hut met with no encourage
 ment. What of that Sueli a man should
 load the van—should he the standard-bearer
 and if Daniel Webster had then, and through
 every step of this whole scheme for ten years
 past, raised Ins voi-e boldly against it, none
 can tell what his influence m ght have ef
 fected—how much evil might have been pre
 vented.
 Hut he has been a Utile dilatory in this
 matter. 1 don’t know much f ins private
 habits; hut if they are like his Senatorial
 ones, it is to lx: feared that the Mansfield
 farm is not ploughed and planted in time, the
 crops not cared for in season that his dinner
 must be cold (possibly eaten up) before he
 gets to the table in shoit, that he is always
 too late. It must certainly be otherwise in
 the Supreme Court, for he gels agooJ deal of
 business, and spends considerable time there
 during the session of Congress and men are
 not apt to trust their business even to a great
 man who is not prompt in earing lor it.
 However, the .-biggish lion has shaken his
 mane, and made Ins voice heard, though not a
 very kingly roar after all, but still a respeeta
 able noise, that might possibly have driven
 the wolves from the carcase, had ft been made
 before they had devoured it. But we may
 expect more front the same source for Mr.
 \V ebstrr speaks as though the matter must be
 looked to. Perhaps lie may make another
 speech after the treaty is ratified, money paid,
 Mexican Senators on the floor, &amp;c., &amp;c., and
 tell us all aliout it, how lie wanted to rouse
 public attention, and all that.
 Meanwhile, let everyone read this speech,
 and mark how well the most important parts
 of it would have applied to times gone by—

 SiM'.iNuma.n, Mass. March, 1848.
 Frieno Douglass:— O.i Sunday evening
 the 12th inst., Henry If. Garnet, delivered a
 lecture at the Town Hall, on the subject of
 the Past and Pres .nit condition, and the fu
 ture destiny of the colored race.” He was
 favored with a respectable, intelligent and at
 tentive audience. His lectuie was a rich pro
 •duction of great effort and research. Hv his
 sound reasoning, substantiated by facts and
 testimonies, he w holly disposed of the igno
 rant and foolish idea, that ihc white man is
 mentally superior to the colored man, in all
 cases and under all circumstances.” lie il
 lustrated the fact, by quotations from Herodo
 tus, regarding the Egyptians who where col
 ored and had woolly hair, and proved to a de
 monstration, that the Anglo .Saxons, borrow
 ed their Arts, Sciences, Ac., from that race,
 lie referred to Solomon's beautiful Egyptian
 bride and his song of devotion dedicated to
 lnsqueen. lie instanced from ancient history,
 iho names of Terence, Cyprian, Hannibal,
 Ac.; andaToussaint J/Ouvcrture, Ogee, Dos
 saline, Christoph, Dumas, Plaeide, of mod
 ern date. The lecturer painted in glowing
 terms, the progress of the colored race, con
 sidi ring x heir present oppressed condition, their
 great exertions and perseverance notwithstand
 ing the countless disadvantages and depriva
 tions to which they are subjected, and urged
 them to press onward and upward, to regain
 that point of human greatness —that high emi
 nence, that has so distinguished and rendered
 the memory of those names illustrious. He
 sjNtke with much power and effect, of the
 4*arly history of Slavery in the railed States;
 4&gt;f the landing of the 101 Puritans on dreary
 Plymouth rock,at the name perils! when a
 Dutch vessel landed ‘2O Africans at Jamestown.
 iiat an infamous coincidence V\ hat dis
 cordant sounds the uotex of Liberty and the
 groans of Slavery simultaneously pealing on
 the air. Ht: tore ofi'the hellish inask of the
 Oilomzation Society; exposed its intrigues,
 and proved ao as to convince even Mr. Clay,
 if lie would but acknowledge the right of
 justice and the force of reason, that it is moral
 ly impo*sib!e for a society with principles so
 corrupt ever to succeed. He pictured the hor
 rid mean* by which our progenitors had been
 stolen from their fatherland, and colonized in
 to this country the absurdity to attempt to
 colonize us back again to Africa. “If this is
 good for the colored man, is it not equally
 *o for the white man 1 The people of tins
 country “of different natures, marvclouslly
 mixed,” all would have to swell the tide of
 colonization. What a chaos 1 The coloni
 zation scheme, is nothing more nor let* than
 prejudice founded on injustice *nd porpetu
 irtt d by folly,” am! hence it cannot vuccctd.
41 There are tome of on? people/ 4 said the
 lecturer, 41 who err out they hate do country
 —they own no home.” TWn he deanmvred
 j an empty declamation. Thla is out county an
 much a* it u* that of any other race, both by
 i birth and adoption; am) it ia a sickening com*
 plaint, that sometime* come a ringing in
 j our car*, We hate no country—wc own
 no home Let us now rue by what moral
 means we may throw off this spirit of des
 pondency, and to a man. as far as it our
 power, ajfitate agitate! agitate until the
 monster Slavery, is for ever annihilated, and
 our rights and immunities are guaranteed to
 us as citraensof this Republic.” He also repu
 diated the party feuds and disnentions. too
 common arming out people said that some
 men have pneUituted good talents for the pur
 pose of kindling the fire of discord. Some
 who oflH.it" at tha temple, said to be dedica
 ted to trod, art: idolaters to sectarianism and
 some too, would draw a line of blood distinc
 tion and form factions ujhjii tbe shallow basis
 i of complexion. He was glad to know that
 the number of I hi* class is small; and small as
 it is, he prayed th3t we may soon be able to
 write a cypher in its place. Ilia remarks seem
 ed to reach a Rev. Sir, who took from them
 inopportune issue, and he hit w hat he aimed
 at—nothing.”
 I understood from Mr. Garnet, that it was
 his intention to publish bis lecture soon. I
 trust he rn iv. It is replete with facts and
 testimonies, of sterling worth, calculated to
 prove of inestimable benefit to the cause and
 advancement of humanity. He closed his dis
 course with the expression of a bright hope of
 the future destiny of the colored rare. What
 f,‘l! from the lip*of this eloquent orator, was
 enough to arouse and animate everyone—man
 and woman, to great exertions and action, to
 reach that pinnacle of human excellence w ait
 ing in store for us. Great men have come
 out of Egypt. Ethiopia shall yet stretch
 forth her hands, and produce men on earth
 famous itv the grave illustrious; in the
 Heavens immortal!”

 IS IGNORANCE BLISS
 Th :tc arc those w hom it is impossible to
 consider other than the friends of humanity—
 of all men, colored as well as white, who are
 nevertheless, occasionally guilty of the ex
 pression of what appears exceedingly like
 pro-slavery sentiment in its most insidious and
 worst form. They are no doubt led to this
 by the peculiar views which they advocate,
 and the opinions they hold in reference to
 other evils nearly akin to slavery. A corre
 spondent of Young America, writing from
 est Florida, lias the following:
 1 have had ample opjMirtunities of judging
 impartially between the relative ihinrnts of
 W ages and liatlel Slaveiv in mv observa
 tions at the south, and, as humiliating as the
 confession may appear, I would much prefer
 f 'hsutel Slavery here, to ages Slavery in
 New \ork. Isay this honestly, sincerely.
 '1 he glorious boon of nominal liberty, to which
 the northern slave attaches such iuqiortaucr,
 (to us:: a homely illustration,) I can only liken
 to a pnr/c hors?, eating shavings through
 green spectacles, and cheating himself into
 the belief that he is grazing in green pasture
 lields. The condition of the chattel is far
 less degrading, lie is generally well fed,
 and better el allied than the mass of wages
 slaves in New York. True, his lot is cruel,
 harsh, severe. Rut with him, ignorance is
 bliss,” want and hunger are not whispering
 in his heart, steal, steal/ and no prison doors
 are yawning to receive him when stern neces
 sity forces such an alternative.
 1 was considerably in doubt, on reading this
 extract, whether I had read correctly; and it
 was not until having read it ihrce several
 times, that 1 was fully persuaded thir.'i was
 no mistake. Rut, after all, does the writer
 mean what he says? 44 1 would much prefer
 wages slavery here to chattel slavery in New
 York. The condition of the chattel is
 fai less degrading. lie is generally well
 fed. True, his lot is erne], harsh, severe.
 But with him ignorance is bliss.’ There
 are not a few who will question the accuracy
 of some of these statements and no wonder.
 (Hi, they must have been written at random,
 and cannot be understood to express the sen
 timents of the w riter. The w hole passage is
 so absurd and unaccountable, that it seems
 impossible to argue the ca&gt;e. lie would pre
 f r chattel slavery in Florida to wages slavery
 in New ork and why Recause the chattel
 slave is generally well fed,” and with
 him ignorance is bli.&gt;s Most cogent
 reasons, certainly, and especially cogent, if a
 man were a horse, which the writer seems
 rather too apt to forget that he is not. Does
 the w riter desire to elevate man Yes; he
 would till his lielly, and make him fat and
 sleek.” Men boast of their superiority to
 the brute creation, in their jiossession of know
 ledge, and some have imagined that they
 boasted rightly; but they must surely have
 been mistaken for all that they need care
 about, according to this writer, is to be well
 fil'd, and live in tbe bliss of ignorance. Does
 not the ox that is fed lor the slaughter enjoy
 tbe same bliss Yes and greater bliss, for
 the ox lias no higher aspirations. It is better, i
 then, to be a slave than a man lietter, also
 to be an ox than a slave Oh, monstrous!*
 What can be meant by the assertion that the 1
 “condition of the chattel is far less degrad
 ing than that of the free laborer, it is
 utterly impossible to imagine. Slavery lias
 been generally considered to lx' t|, e u ,ir»t
 of all evils under w hich humanity cau suffer.
 Is not the slave iu West Florida, a* else
 where, kept in ignorance, degraded into a
 brute—a mere ffring automaton, that is not
 permitted in aWjfjfagree to think or act for
 himself? Is lie not subject to be bought, and
 sold, and beat, at the whim or caprice ef his*
 master’ Are not all his hopes, and affec-'
 lions, and expectations, liable to be blasted at
 any moment, at the will of another Yes
 he is all this and yet, says the writer of this
 letur, lus condition is f.ir less degrading”
 than that of the wages slave. What, theu, i
 must be the condition that is more degrading!
 M here shall we look for the miserable beings!
 w ho arc Us victims» Can w e conceive of any j
 deeper degradation than this» Have we ever
 wen or read of it» Can this be said of thr 1
 intelligent and reading working man of New 1
 England* His condition is sometimes hard!
 motigh. It is not needful fo deny, that lie
 las bis cares, and anxieties, and diffirultii-s
 rut has he not also his home, and his family J
 md his friends, and the produce of his own
 abor, and the menas of acquiring knowledge,
 md the vigorous incentive of hope, and a
 nanly reliance on his own exertions, and is
 »e not a Fru Max’ Do we find it among
 he free labortt# of tbe QJd Wpikj? Ask
any one of them, evqa the amt virtrM tad
 destitute, whether he woo Id not rather be a
 *la»e, to be bought, and beat, mad branded,
 and kept fat and aleck," fike a valuable
 1 hone, than a free mao la hie earuowtaacee,
 aad he would answer, with a frown of ltadig
 nation. Am I not a naan I” If the writer
 of Um letter w ould indeed prefer the condi
 tion of a chattel, eves when well led, and in
 the bliss of ignorance, to that of the mtdtigem
 and enter pricing freeman, mean indeed must
 be his spirit— fit for a dare.
 Here is another expresewe of setrtim'Trt oe
 this subject, from the Salem (Ohio,) Home
 stead Journal. Speaking of the Abolitionists,
 the w riter say*
 Their sympathies extend only to the
 colored bondtnan, and even with him they
 labor only to diMroy the relationship of master
 and slave. They seek nothing mure than to
 loose him from his prewnt taskmaster, with
 out ever preparing or devising ways and
 means for hts future well-being, or securing
 him from the avaricious chicanery and fraud
 of the commercial chatLl driver. And
 tins is the great boon fur which our Disunion
 friends arc moving Heaven and Earth to ob
 tain for the black slave."
 There are here but three sentences; and in
 these thr e santen jjs there are t nes misrepre
 sentations. First, That the sympathies of
 Abolitionists extend only to the colored bond
 man. This is so palpably untrue, in refer
 ence to the sentiments of Abolitionists, whose
 philanthropy is man-wide and world-wide,
 that it requires not a word of commentary,
 but is its own b.-st refutation. Second,
 where does this w riter learn, that Abolitionists
 seek nothing more than to loose l!ie bond
 man from his present taskmaster I may
 be mistaken, but have been in the habit of
 supposing, from w hat I know and liave read
 of the sentiments of Abolitionists, that they
 sought freedom for the slave, as the first step
 towards his advancement in the scale of intel
 ligence and humanity. The writer surely
 knows, or might know, that it is impossible
 for the colored bondman in any measure
 to advance, w hilc in a state of bondage that
 it is neeessary, in order to his continuing a
 bondman, that he should continue ignorant.
 Third, They ask this great boon,” not only
 for its own sake—though that also is a matter
 of high import, but more as the means to an
 end—that end the elevation from their present
 brutal degradation, into intelligent human
 beings, of three millions of slaves. There is
 no bliss in ignorance.—j. d.
 London, March 10, 18-18.
 Dear Sir, —The great subject of interest
 in Eutope, is the revolution which has been
 successfully accomplished in France. In the
 year 1830, Louis Philippe was borne to the
 throne on the shoulders of the people, and
 under the title of Citizen King, pledged him
 self to the cause of liberty and progress.
 Hut the atmosphere of a throne is trying to
 morality and whatever may have been the
 sincerity of Louis Philippe's professions, it
 very soon became evident, that the great end
 of his exertions was, the consolidation of his
 power, and the advancement and enrichment
 of his family. In pursuance of these ojects,
 he made common cause with the despots of
 Europe, in his foreign policy, and at home
 endeavored to curtail the liberty of the press,
 and opposed a steady resistance to every kind
 of reform.
 Having thus lost the hearts of the people,
 he clung for support to a fraudulent represen
 tation and the physical force of armies and
 fortifications. He thus contrived to make it
 appear that he governed on constitutional
 principles, being always supported by a ma
 jority in the Chambers. But, in the first
 place, the Deputies were elected by a very
 limited proportion of the population; and
 secondly, there were at least one-third of
 them officers of government—men who w ould
 therefore support whatever ministry the king
 might prefer. Feeling the insecurity of his
 position, he surrounded Paris with fortifica
 tions, and filled it with armed men. The
 result has proved how unavailing is the
 strongest force and the most cunning fraud,
 when opposed to an enlightened people deter
 mined to be free.
 The conduct of the provisional government
 has been been beyond all praise. Their first
 proclamation ended with the motto of the
 new republic, Liberty—Equality—Frater
 nity and all the subsequent ones have been
 true to this great and Christian profession.
 They have addressed circulars to all their
 ministers at foreign courts, expressing their
 sincere desire for the maintenance of peace.
 They have abolished the Chamber of Peers
 and all titles of nobility; have decreed the
 separation of the church from the state have
 abolished capital punishment for political
 offences, and are preparing a measure for the
 Emancipation of the Neoroes in their
 Colonies.
 What may be the ultimate form which
 their goverumeut will take, depends upon the
 decision of the constituent assembly, which
 has been convoked for the 20th of April. It
 is to be elected by universal suffrage and vote
 by ballot, and is to consist of 900 members,
 being one for every 40,000 of the population.
 Such an event as this cannot fail to affect
 all the Slates of Europe. It was feared at
 first that warlike measures might he under
 taken to embarrass or put down the new:
 republic. The British government, however,
 took the earliest opportunity of declaring that
 they would not in any way interfere w ith the
 iuternal arrangements of France and all the
 despotic powers, with the exception of Russia,
 art' too much troubled with the demands of
 their own subjects for freedom— demands
 which will be greatly encouraged by the
 events in France, and too much embarrassed
 by war debts of long standing, to make anv
 very formidable demonstration against French
 liberty. On the contrary, there is every rea
 son to hope, that the progress of freedom will
 be greatly accelerated by these glorious
 events. Already, many of the lesser State*
 of Germany hare male prompt and satisfac
 tory concessions. The Grand Duke of
 Baden and the Dukes of W une in burg and
 Nassau, have granted freedom of the press,
 trial by jury and other constituuonal rights.
 Prussia promises well, and has convoked the
 •SutetrLhnund. The Belgian government
 have promised a sweeping parliamentary
 reform. All Italy ia potting on the gnrh of
 freedom, and coasoiidtftng itself into one
 great nation. Aeetrie alone, that most ruth
 less and miserable of aU atrocious govern
 ments—a government of absolute force, firmed
 and barbarity, W ithout one redeeming quality
 to mitigate it* degradation, offers an obstinate
 re**lance to the great movement which a Ur j
mates Europe. Martial lav hi ben pro
 rhmncil aLo abardy; Hungary h putting
 ea the attitude of retoelhoe; and it hto be
 hoped that ths galling L-tWra of Austria are
 to be at last and hrercr broken. But the
 caotest mi) he aerate; for Paeon nail Prussia
 bare agreed to assist the A net nan govern
 ment againet m oppressed subject?., wbo wifi
 hare to suffre tnorfa, in one way or other,
 before their freedom a attained. But, as the
 poetsaya,
 Fnwl—% battle once begee,
 Though «Am loot, is diriji worn.* 1
 It began from one end of Europe to the
 athet. It may be waged thiough much pa
 tience and trihuhtion but the day weems
 already to dawo with the ruing son of Free
 dam.
 The great mass of the people of this
 country sympathise warmly, with the people
 of France and the noble spirit of the pro
 visional government. Should the French
 succeed with their republic, no doubt England
 will profit by the example, and raise again
 the banner of reform. There has been some
 rioting in London and other large towns, but
 it has been confined entirely to the ignorant
 and degraded, who swarm in painful numbers
 in all the groat centres of population in this
 country. It is not by any such proceeding
 that Great Britain will work out its freedom,
 but by the energetic agitation of public
 opiipon, acting in a constitutional way on tlie
 government and parliament, and thus obtain
 ing gradually, yet surely, all necessary re
 forms. The true friends of freedom here
 are not rioting, but bolding public meetings,
 and sending friendly adtjresscs to the French
 nation. A large and enthusiastic meeting
 was held last Friday in the Hall of Com
 merce, at which an eloquent address, which
 had been prepared by Elihu Burritt, was
 agreed to, and is to be conveyed to the pro-;
 visional government by Joseph Sturgp, Ed
 ward Miall, and other gentlemen.
 Nothing particular has occurred in the
 British parliament since last mad, except the l
 withdrawal ol the proposed government mea-'
 sure to raise the income tax from three to five
 per cent, on all incomes exceeding jCISO per'
 annum. The determined resistance which
 the nation is making to increased taxation, is
 a strong guarantee for peace; and it seems
 now to he generally believed that it w ill be
 almost impossible to drag us into a war.

 A CARD,
 Frvm the Prvprict &gt;r» of the Anglo-Saj'ii," to their
 Punn.t,
 Malicious Robbery.— Between 11 o’clock
 on Saturday night, 25th ult.. and six o'clock
 on the morning of the following Monday, our
 office was entered hv some person or persons
 unknown, who carried off three new Mail
 B*K)ks, into which the names of our subscri
 bers had been lately transferred. The en
 velopes already written for the next number
 of our paper, our old mail-hooks, and evory
 hing tending to give us the slightest clue to
 the residence of our subscribers, were also
 carried off. '1 hose were the only articles
 taken, although there were many valuable
 lxxiks, articles of wearing apparel, printer's
 materials, &amp;c., &amp;c., in the room where the
 robbery was pcrpeirated, as well as in the
 other rooms of our cstabluhment. We do
 not therefore attribute the theft to a profession
 al thief, but to some villain who was envious
 of our success, or who, fancying himself
 aggrieved by us, took this unlawful and mali
 emus means of revenging himself—rightly im
 agining that to cut us off from all communica
 tion with our subscril&gt;ers, would he the nexl
 thing to a death-blow to us, and to the imme
 diate progress of the literary reform advocated
 by us.
 Ijnder the circumstances, we have done al!
 that can be done. We have sent a copv ol
 this Card to every editor in the 1 niter
 States and B. North America, requesting then
 to copy it. Our Subscribers are requested t«
 write to us immediately, informing us to wha
 number, or to about what number, their sub
 scriptions extend. We will immediately eu
 ter their names in a new mail book already
 prepared for that purpose. We will continm
 receiving these names until May Ist. Unit
 then, we will not publish the next regulai
 number of the Anglo-Saxon. By this ar
 rangement, none of the articles on Pho
 neties,'’ by Zablid Haurits, nor any othe
 matter relating to the immediate object of the
 paper, will be lost to our subscribers?: In th«
 mean time we shall strike off several thousand
 copies, containing interesting matter to begin
 ners, and circulate them gratuitously among
 teachers all over the country
 We trust that it is unnecessary to reqnesi
 our subscribers, that as this misfortune ha?
 placed us entirely at thoir mercy, they will, il
 they do not remember the exact number ai
 which their subscription expires, rather givt
 us than themselves, the benefit of then
 doubts. It will t&gt;e necessary for them, at any
 rate, to state definitely, up to what numhei
 they are entitled, to the of their belief—
 as il will be useless for them to leave us ti
 decide ujxm the merits of their respective ca
 ses—we having lost all memoranda of oui
 transactions w ith them. May we not also ask
 them, under the.se circumstances, to pay their
 own postage
 The above notice has been sent to us with
 a request for insertion. We sympathize with
 the proprietors of the Anglo-Saxon, in
 the loss they have sustained, and have pleas
 ure in complying with the request.
 P~r* Dr. M. R Dylan y made a pretty good
 speech the other evening, and thirs were
 more in attendance than under the circum
 stances could be expected. He showed up
 the ridiculousness and ahsurdity of prejudice
 against color, and proved that it was nothing
 but prejudice against condition. W e have
 not this feeling towards a black coat, horse,
 boots, or even a black glove—because the
 condition of slave is not marked upon them
 and even this aversion lost its influence when
 we know the adored man is a slave. Slave
 holders themselves seem to know liule about
 it. Mr. D. gives good evidf-nee that he can
 take care of himself. —A«* Lisbon (O.)

 her or wermuv hew yoek.
 Undw a deep sad zbkhng imprwiuo of tfe
 duty are owe to God and ear feOo* being*,
 the AMKSbrm won* of Rochester led
 caoMnuard to eoetmae to persevere ia tben
 cffuis far the oppressed and suffering bond
 men who still ramus toiling unrequited ia the
 Soathvrn prison house. Wc »re frequently
 brought painfully to remember that not nnljr
 is their labor vrated from them unrcnuincra
 ted; not only do they suffer front interne hun
 ger and cold; not only are the female*, ora
 sums, subjected to tW cruel and pamiuoate
 outrages of their tyrannical masters and over
 seers but theta are daily instances of sun
 dering the dearest ties in nature, thus srpa
 rating them forever. And can we expert any
 thing better—ran vre look for benevolence or
 fine feelings from a system so foul and fiend
 ish as slavery! It would be unreasonable,
 because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
 good fruit.*’ Therefore, knowing that with
 out associative sfction wfi cannot render effi
 cient aid to this holy cause, we affectionately
 invite the e»i-operatiun of the citizens of Huch
 ester and the public g?nerallv. We ask them
 to bear in mind the injunctions of Jesus,“All
 things whatsoever ye would men should do to
 you, do ye even so to them.” Rememlier,
 also, the beautiful parable in w hich hr calls
 our attention to the sick and to those who arc
 in prison, and concludes bv the tumble asser
 tion, “Inxsmuch as ye have done it toon‘of the
 least of these, my brethren, ye have done it
 unto me.” We feel assured all that have
 hearts to feel, and are careful to attend to the
 monitions of conscience—all who are deter
 mined to live for the good of our race, instead
 of devoting all their time to their own per
 sonal ease—all who feel bound to improve the
 precious time allotted to them here, by pio
 moting as much as possible the cause of truth
 and righteousness in the earth, will come for
 ward in the work of laboring to banish forever
 the demon of slavery from our land and in
 so doing, instead of an example of corruption
 and wickedness, we should be a lightto the
 world.”
 e hope no one will feel too poor, nor any
 too rich, to enlist in this holy cause. The
 Christian's influence, in whatever situation, is
 always salutary, and will certainly produce its
 good effects. We ask for the aid of men and
 of women; —we call on the old and the
 young, the farmer, the mechanic, and the
 merchant. We ask all and every one to give
 us their help to devote what they can sj&gt;are,
 either of money or of the fruits of their la
 bor, to the work of restoring men and women
 to themselves, to their manhood, to the rights
 and blessings with which they were endowed
 by our Creator.
 For this object, we propose holding a Fair
 in December next. We ask the females in
 the adjoining towns and country around us, to
 get up sewing circles, and prepare such arti
 cles as will be most saleable, and to come, fur
 nish tables, give us their company, and help
 us, not only in selling those things thus pre
 pared, but in convincing the public mind of
 the necessity of our perseverance and fidelity,
 and thus be helpers in hastening the day of
 emancipation.

 Tfa motive** which have artieitsd tfa aetfar iu
 j preparing the work, are *.Wh a
 desire to interest ami enlighten tfa puMic wi-nl, on
 a suliject intimately connected with I lie happiness or
 misery of a large portion of the human family an
 fa a relation of farts and testimonies, which m&gt;
 assertions ran annul. to remove a deeply-rooted pre
 judice, existing iu the minds of many, respecting the
 African race.
 It is an imimrtant nnrstion whether tfa Xc*m i*
 constitutionally, an I therefore irremediably inferior
 to tlte whit»* man, in the powers of the mind. Much
 of the future w elfare of the human rare depends on
 the answer which experience and facts will furnish
 jto this question: for it concents not oidv tlk* vast
 |x&gt;pulati&lt;&gt;n of Africa. Itnt many millioes of tin- Nt-gru
 rare, wlm are locat'd elsewhere, and tlte whites who
 are liemning mixed w ifh tlte Mack race, in countries
 where Slavery exists, or wfaro it has existed till
 within a recent (vriid. Many persons have ventur
 ed upon peremptory decisions on Mtth si les of tlir
 question; In»tthe ntajoritv apfrsrto he still unsatis
 fied as to tlte real caput ilities of tlte Negro ntre.—
 Tlk-ir jiresent aciiml inferiority in many resjtects
 comparing tltem as a whole with the lighter colour
 ed portion of titanki'td, is too evident tol.-e disputed;
 latt it ninst lie borne in mind that they arc not in ti
 fit condition for a liiir roiii|Kirisoa to lie diawti be
 tween the two. Their present degiaded state may
 lie easily accounted for by flu- circumstances antidsl
 w hich Negroes lihvc lived, Isitli in their own country
 and afaoad. Ifa single instance can lie adduced ol
 an individual of tlte African nice exhibiting a genii:*
 which would be considered eminent in civilized Euro
 pean society, we have a proof that there is no incom
 patibility fatwcen Negro organization and high in
 tellcctnalpower. But it i&lt; not one alone, but many
