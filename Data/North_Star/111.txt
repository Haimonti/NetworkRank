 I am fearful that the agent of the executor
 or (he execu or himself, ie about to wronj
 theae people out of the mean* and propeitj
 left th *tn by John Randolph. The land (run
 which they were driven by mob violence, u
 now refused them by the agent, on the au
 thonty of bee, the executor, a* 1 am inform-.i
 by respectable mtellige.it white farm ra
 neighbors to th *e people, except they agre
 to pay for it, although the land ia limr own
 already paid for, w ith money willed them b&lt;
 the man w h im they served and w ore out thei
 strength with, and almost their lives. Hr
 excuse for this unjust demand is, that he de
 sires to sell all the land, some thirty liiousam
 acres, then divide the money equally amonf
 them. Nor is there a remedy for this w iu&gt;L
 sale imposition, as 1 am informed that I
 holds a v arraniy deed of all the lan I*, rnadt
 to himself, liens, executors a.d assigns.
 Now, where is the guarantee of these people
 in the event of th&lt;* demine of Mr.
 Have they an security No, none at all
 none, iiemg themselves very ignorant, and
 km wing noli ting but w bat they are tuid by
 otners, tiipy ar easily unjs**. d upon and
 ever, nuw, under all the circumstances of the
 case, are wilting to believe that the executor
 and age..t are acting justly toward them. I
 Heh how. v* r, tliat there are none but
 themselves w ho so bcheve.
 I'ney have been greatly imposed upon by
 people in Ohio, in buying articles. 1 shall
 name one or two cases for instance, in the
 purchase of a tub, winch cost but one dollar,
 the store keeper from w hom the purchase was
 made, received a five dollar note, which he
 kept; but the man suspecting something,
 went to the gentleman from whom he had
 received the money, who looking over the
 balance, detected the fraud but then who
 dare accuse a respectable person with so mean
 an act Another lost ten dollars in like man
 ner. This was in an&lt;l alsmt Troy.
 Old horses, old plows, and other farming
 utensils, worn out and good for nothing, are
 frequently sold to them at high prices, all
 under the name of Abolitionists, which,when
 the hand is discovered, tends very much to
 their discouragement. Hence, some of them
 have been known to say, that they would
 rather be back in Virginia again. These im
 postors “steal the livery of heaven to serve
 tbe devil in,” and richly deserve the execra
 tion of all just men.
 There is a school taught among the Ran
 dolph people ip this settlement, by Lucv
 Coates, an amiable young lady of the denomi
 nation of Friends. This 1 conceive to be
 quite self-sacrificing on the part of Miss
 Coates, as she could do much better by teach
 ing otb if schools. There are some few white
 children go to this school, it is true, but the
 greater part by far, are of the Randolph peo
 ple, who are very poor, having been cheated
 out of the legacy left them by Mr. Randolph,
 They have nothing now but what they earn
 by hard labor this portion of them being bv
 far, if there can.bc* such a difference, the most
 intelligent and in the most comfortable cir
 cumstances those near Troy, ten miles dis
 tant, appearing quite dissatisfied and dejected.
 And no wonder they should be so, as it ap
 pears to be familiar to all that at the death of
 Randolph they were to obtain their liberty and
 fall heir to his estate. Thus have they been
 robbed and cheated, and why should they not
 be dej**cted 1 would not appear uncharita
 ble, but I am disposed to believe, viewing all
 the circumstances, that there was collision
 between the parlies in tbe purchase and sale
 of this land fur the Randolph people. It will
 be remember .id that after the putchaee, im
 msdixtel y at the instance of an attempt on the
 part of the people to s* tile on their land,
 bought and paid lor, the tool* was raised,
 composed of the very m n from whom the
 purchase was made ai d singular that during
 all this imposition and ouirage on the part u!
 these Ohioans, we see neither executor noi
 agent enter litigation in the case, but likf
 good pear ml Christians, told their atms, anc
 express ti. *ir regret at the occurrence. Anc
 be it further r tneinbered, that so soon as the
 peopl are effectually repulsed, discourager
 and scattered, those who rejected them, im
 meiutely waive all objections, and invite then
 v com and settle on their lands.
 A‘d what then* Why, no sooner is tlii:
 done, th.w the executor refuses them permit
 cion, for the reasons 1 have already slated!—
 What means art tins' Remember what
 now predict—the secrets of this ncfarioui
 transaction will yet be reve U )ed.
 I am aware that I shall be subject io cen
 sure, by both friends and foes, for tbe coursi
 I have pursued in thus liberally expressing
 my opinion but as I have taken my stand bi
 one of the sentinels on the watch-tower o
 the liberties of our brethren, J never intern
 to leave the ramparts, nor suffer an approach
 of the enemy unmolested, until my colors
 first be grounded in the hands of the faller
 helpless victims, who dared, in the midst of s
 tempest ot oppression, such as now surrounds
 us, Stand upon the citadel, and unfurl its
 proud drapery to the gaze and dismay of the
 enemies of our race, and the dearest rights ol

 Fbcokiick Doccuii: My deir Sir,

 I was n&lt;* probable that I should ever see him

 B t I take up my pen to testify, in a few
 word;-, to the good character of the colom
 people &lt;*f th;-&gt; city. They number one thou
 sand, and are as a ciass, industrious, frugal
 temperate, upright and intelligent. I hav&lt;
 spent a Sa'rbith with them. In the morning
 I attended their M rthodist, and in the after
 noon, their Baptist church. Mr. Gardner ii
 the pastor of the former, and Mr. Davis ol
 the latter. Mr. Davis is a neat, beautiful,
 and able w riter, lie formerly lived m Buf
 falo. He is a native of Maine.
 I And several acquaintances among the
 colored people of this city—namely, Robert
 Batiks, George R. Symes, Lewis ILtydon,
 and Henry Bibb and his wife. Banks and
 Symes were members of the colored school,
 which was sustained for several years in my
 little village. They are very worthy men.
 Mr. Bib!) is preparing to go to England this
 Fail. Ilis special employment there will be
 to advocate the disuse of the products of slave
 labor. His worthy wife will probably ac
 company him. Among the most estimable
 colored men of this city is Mr. George Bap
 tist. I owe him much for his kind and use
 ful attention to me.
 The colored people of this city justify
 themselves for congregating heie, instead ol
 scattering in the interior, on the ground that
 they can thereby better protect themselves
 from men-stealers, and can thereby bettet
 protect from meo-stealers the almost daily
 arriving fugitives from the Southern prison
 house. A large share of the colored people
 of this city are fugitive slaves.
 VV hat a land is this, in which the poor and
 the weak arc obliged to congregate them

 a people, even though their Constitution liar
 i been dropped down from Heaven, would in
 terprel it in behalf of justifying the oppres
 sion and devouring the poor. They havi
 already in the Bible a Heaven-sent Constitu
 tion and thus wickedly and blasphemously
 do they interpret it.
 With great r egard,
 Your friend and brother,

 I doubt not; and I'll draw it out for you.—
 You were not, I think, introduced to Mr.
 Willard Burnham, who is my brut bur's near
 est neighbor, in Cleveland, as well as a par
 ticular friend of mine. Mr B. went to Co
 lumbus th other day, to attend the conven
 tion of all s-.iris of p iple. to protest againsi
 i the nominations of Taylor and Cass. ()i
 his wly thither, he travelled in company
 with several who were returning from Uu
 Philadelphia Convention. Among these wer&lt;
 some three of four slaveholders. Mr. Burn
 ham, conversing with one of the latter, tool
 occasion to say, among other things, that i
 the slaves were liberated, he did not doub
 ihey would soon become intelligent, intellect
 j ,j al and respectable, like other men. That'i
 impossible; they are an inferior race voi
 never can make any of them intellectual,’
 j said the slaveholder. But,” rejoined Mr

 w ho, escaping from your slavery some sevei
 or eight years ago, without scarce knowing
 the alphabet, is now one of the best speaker
 i we have has been to England, Scotland ant
 Ireland, where he was most favorably receivet
 I h classes of society, and where his elo
 quence excited general admiration and he
 now edits a paper. A ou’d better take it.”—
 I will, quickly responded the slaveholder
 i handed to Mr. B. the enclosed ivvt
 dollars, which, at the latter's request, I havi
 the pleasure of transmitting to you. Tin
 individual is a lawyer, and practises his pro
 iession at New Orleans, but has a plautatior
 at the place to which I have requested vou U
 send your paper. I fancy you had bettor noi
 publish his name, for reasons w hich will lx
 obvious to you though Mr. B. did not,
 think, that he enjoined any seerect

 If you have any difficulty in decipheiinj

 Slavery and the Slave Trade.
 At a meeting recently held in London, ol
 persons anxious to uphold the system of free
 labor in the British Colonies, and to prevenl
 Britain from being dependent for its supply
 ol sugar and coffee upon the produce of slave
 labor, the following resolution was proposed
 by Samuel Gurney.
 That this meeting, consisting of merchants,
 bankers; and others, of the city of Loudon,
 1 assembled, without regard to the political
 I views or private mieresis of any class of bet
 Majesty's subjects, is of opinion that, while
 it is an object of greut importance to the peo
 i pie of this country to obtain an abundant and
 "heap supply of sugar an 1 coJee, it is no less
 desirable to combine with that object t..e
 omniHoaaee of a system of fre.) ia *&gt;r which
 j has ot-en established at so great a sicnlice in
 toe British colonial possessions.”
 Mr. Gurney said, iu support of the resolu
 tion, he thought that, if the people of Eng
 land tuoroughty understood the whole of tbs
 case, there would ba ninety-nuie out of every
 hundred of them who would Tote against pro
 j tection in favor of slave-grown sugar. Since
 Id to, a great change has taken place on the
 i suojeet of tue »iuve-tra le. Up to that time
 the slave trade iud oeen cheesed by the Bril
 tsh aui other Governments and (he Brains
 and dpaiu, not by treaty, but by acts, Wouiu

 oeen admitted to this country at that time.—

 Address of Anti-Slavery Women of West
 ern New York.
 j
 T T nder a deep and abiding impression of the
 duty we owe to God and our fellow beings,
 the Anti-Slavery women of Rochester feel
 constrained to continue to persevere iu then
 j effurif for the oppressed and suffering bond
 j men who aul! remain toiling unrequited iu the
 Southern prison house. We are frequently
 brought painfully to remember that not only
 i 3 their labor wrested from them nnremunera
 tod; not only do they suffer from intense hun
 ger and cold not only are the females, our
 I sisters, subjected to Uw cruel and passionate
 i outrages of their tyrannical masters and over
 seers but there are daily instances of si.n
 dering the dearest ties in nature, thus sepa
 rating them forever. And can we expect any
 -1 thing better—can we look for benevolence m
 line feelings from a system so foul and fiend
 j ish as slavery? It would be unreasonable,
 i because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
 good fruit.” Therefore, knowing that with*
 out associative action we cannot render effi
 cient aid to this holy cause, we affectionately
 invite th co-operation of the citizens of Roch
 ester and the public generally. We ask their
 to hear in mind the injunctions of Jesus, “Ah
 things whatsoever ye would men should do t&lt;
 you, do ye even so to them.” Remember,
 also, the beautiful parable in which he calls
 our attention to the sick and to those who arc
 in prison, and concludes by the forcible asser
 tion, “Inasmuch as ye have done it toone of the
 least of these, my brethren, ve have done it
 unto me.” We feel assured all that have
 hearts to feel, and are careful to attend to the
 monitions of conscience—all who are deter
 mined to live for the good of our race, instead
 of devoting all their time to their own per
 sonal ease—all who feel bound to improve the
 precious time allotted to them here, bv pro
 moting as much as possible the cause of truth
 and righteousness in the earth, will come for
 ward in the work of laboring to banish forever
 tire demon of slavery from our land and hi
 so doing, instead of an example of corruption
 and wickedness, we should be a light to the
 world.”
 We hope no one will feel too poor, nor any
 to&lt;i rich, to enlist in this holy cause. The
 Christian’s influence, in whatever situation, is
 always salutary, and will certainly produce its
 good effects. We ask for the aid of men and
 of wo.n m we call on the old and the
 young, the farmer, the mechanic, and th&lt;
 merchant. We ask all and every one to giv&lt;
 us their help to devote what they can spare
 either of money or of the fruits of their la
 bor, to the work of restoring men and womei
 to themselves, to their manhood, to the right:
 and blessings with winch they were endowei
 by our Creator.
 For this object, we propose holding a Fai
 in December next. We ask the females h
 the adjoining towns and country around us, u
 get up sewing circles, ami prepare such arii
 cles as will be most saleable, and to come, fur
 nish tables, give us their company, and help
 us, not only in selling those things thus pre
 pared, but in convincing the public mind o;
 the necessity of our perseverance and fidelity
 and thus be helpers in hastening the day o
 emancipation.
