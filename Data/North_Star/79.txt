 is that of three Ui one; and it must be recol
 lected that all territories that have been pup-1
 cliased, and all wars in support of them, have
 lieen paid for out of tlie nation* purse;"
 j and it must be further recollected, that all
 such territory has bee* exclusively for one
 section; that slavery, that fciltor-degradiug
 institution, lias been esttblfshed in ihem, and
 i the self-r ’sj&gt;eclitig, working freemen of the
 North have been effectually axel tided from

 Uiicoki.vn, April 17th, 1818.
 National Character.

 i Many people seem to he very much trou
 bled with the idea that the Abolitionists, bv
 exposing national sins, are defaming national
 character. Admitting the existence of gan
 grened spots upon the body jnilitie, they
 seem to think it is better to let them alone,
 persuading ourselves that they will disappear
 in time, if they are not disturbed, ahd leave
 the body in a perfectly normal slate. .The
 American people emerged into ait ind-pendent
 j national existence with a dark slain upon their
 j national character, which has been deepening
 and spreading, until the whole material Iras
 become tinged with its peculiar dye. The
 i eyes of the world are fixed upon it, not as an
 abstraction, but as an arbitrary fact, which
 j neither apologies nor evasions can disguise or
 conceal, and which can be erased only by an
 j atonement commensurate with the crime.
 Judging from the vaunting tone of a large
 j portion oi the Americau press, one would
 suppose that the national character had never
 i been sullied by a single stain, and that the
 I nation was advancing with rapid strides,
 j through scenes of rapine, rohbcrrv and car
 nage, to the acme of human greatness.—
 scents that the martial prowess of the na
 tion was not sufficiently established by the
 tlnee wars preceding the present, and that
 i there was danger that the American people
 1 would become a peace-loving nation of cow
 ards. And there was also danger that the
 institution of slavery, so dearly loved and
 warmly cherished by a portion of the people,
 pent up within circumscribed limits, would
 j lose its vitality, and fail of henig transmitted,
 I unimpaired, to future nges; therefore, in or
 dor to secure the national character against
 the imputation of cow ardice, aud u&gt; preserve
 tlie institution of slavery from present ami
 future danger, it became necessary to involve
 the nation in a war with Mexico, the barbar
 ous details of which future ages will find re
 corded among the annals of our national
 crimes. We do nut snlficiuiiUy realise (fie
 fart, that a national character *pry,g* from,
 and is sustained by, individual accuns and
 we Wish to apply that remark to the American
 iicople in particular; for no other people po».
 acss the facilities which they posses, for the
 formation and development of a national char
 acter. There is no other nation in the woild

 Friend Dor or. ass :—Partly because lie'
 may hive omitted it, and partly because he.
 might feel some delicacy in say ng what 11
 may say, I will lell that M. R. Delany has
 been in this place, where lie addressed one j
 audience on National Reform, and two on
 I Anti-Slavoty, all, so far as I hare ascertained, i
 with general acceptance. lie is one of those 1
 cases to whom reference may be made in
 proof that black persons may he elevated— j
 i j that is, that by industrious application, iudi-1
 ''duals, net of the privileged class, may rise
 to intellectual respectability. I could wish
 1 j attention might lie unceasingly called to ob
 -1 serration of this fact, not knowing of a more
 effectual mode of producing conviction of our
 &gt;i common brolherliood: It may well be ques
 tioned whether the.improvement, whatever it
 may be, of earth's concerns, enn be tmeed to j
 superior organisations, or superisr instruc-!
 tions, so certainly as to untiring efforts for
 ,self-improV(*nent. At wide distances are
 fctars of the first magnitude but the light we
 .receive from the second, third, Ac., exceeds!
 I all that the first shed upon us. My hopes'
 are based on the careful culture of ordinary
 minds they outnumber all above and below
 them, and are conscious .that their chief reii-
 jancc must be oil theiriindefatigable in-J
 1 iluslry. i- r •-»V*
 kV hen I had written the above, the North
 Star came from the Post Office. On looking
 mcr its pages, I saw an article under the
 caption, Education,** and that recalled to
 j memory that in back numbers I had been
 pleased to observe that the subject had claimed j
 (attention. 1 hope it will Continue to do so,,
 for on.education everything future depends
 I mean the kind of education, and who gets
 s jit. More than most others, perhaps, I have
 I desired that it might Ihj liberuily extended to:
 all persons of color now excluded by law!
 I Irom its benefits. Thirty years since, I en
 deavored to impress upon audiences of free'
 colored people the important relation in which'
 they stood to their brethren in bonds, and that 1
 they could not aid in their enfranchisemenimore 1
 efficiently than by rising in their intellectual]
 and moral character. We could not long,
 j hold men in slavery whom we feel to be our
 equals mid as Uu; North is the great slave,
 i holder, the North should be enlightened or
 the eqiial susceptibility of improvement.
 If I felt myself warranted in offering *ugw I
 gestions on sny subject, it would be that Re-'
 formers, in all departments, would make edu
 cation prominent; that publishers should make
 tit conspicuous in their periodical*, and it'
 would delight me to set! the North 3tar in!
 the lead. i
 There is work to be done, and operatives;
 should be look mg at their urvrl, and not at us
 'projector*. A Jpretiy good illustration of tbei
 results of doing is in Marlboro’, west of this
 place. A set oif real working Abolitionists, 1
 not having tjie fear of the school law before 1
 their eyes,” have for rears admitted colored 1
 children in sehool on common terms hut not
 satisfied with this, they have had for Director
 Charles who is uot elargcabfo
 with a, &lt;Uop of Anglo-Saxon bloud coursing
 in hi* veins. This was effected by working,
 preitv hard work, and that cusfetmad, but it
 succeeded, and ever must with judicious per- i
 severance.
 Seven or eight years ago, I passed port of

 which he promulgated, and the spirit breathed
 through every word, action or safieringof his.
 It is formed for carrying out those sublime
 truths which He announced to the wr.rfd, and
 cspedally recognizes the Divine authority,
 and deep obligation of the solemn .command,

 r| rf :h mt
 Standing on suck a ground, and embodying
 such glorious prmdphs, the League of Uni
 versal Brotherhood may bn well characterized
 as the most heavenly vision which has blessed
 these latteT days and those who hate the
 interests of humanity at heart, will feel that a
 debt of gratitude is due to the privileged be
 ing whose far-seeing eye caught the first flint
 rays of tills morning star of promise., from
 those pure spiritual heights which seem to bo
 his native sphere, and who announced its
 arising to tite world, as a pledge of hope and
 joy, and of the speedy dawn of a brighter day
 than has, as yet, gladdened this temporary
 home of man’s immortal spirit.
 But if the foundation and {he principles ol
 the League are thus broad j and uo'ule, hardly
 less so is the scope of its capacity and action,
 liove is its esseucc and spirit, and consequent
 ly it is unboundedly expansive and elastic;
 it excludes no human being from the pale of
 its fraternal sympathies none are so outcast,
 aftne so sunk or degraded, that it would not
 rejoice to assist and raise them. But it forms
 no fellowship with evil; those whom it unites
 are united in tlye holy endeavor to break every
 chain of mental or physical thraldom, and to
 'leave man as free as when ho came from the
 hand of bis Maker, acknowledging alone the
 bond of that electric chain of imperishable
 love, which, begtnning and Gliding in the
 Father's throne, and passing through the
 heart of every human. unites lima for
 ever to all humanity and to Go&lt;f. In an espe
 cial m.mner,are the Leaguers pledged against
 all those hateful prejudices of 'color and
 caste w hich are the very groundwork of op
 pression and tyranny in an especial manner
 would they reach out a helping hand to the
 downtrodden millions who are at this day
 toiling in the midst of an enlightened and
 civilized nation, under all the horrors of sla
 very, aggravated by every circumstance oi
 cruelty and hardship.
 They also strive earnestly for the abolitiou
 of all restraints upon international communi
 cation, and advocate a free and unrestricted
 commerce in thought, as well a* in the inure
 material necessaries and accessaries to outward

 existence.
 But whilst no sphere is fetus too wide for
 the action of the principles of the League,
 and the world itself cannot' contain” the
 spirit which pervades it. so also is no sphere
 too narrow or too limited for the exercise of
 the duties which it enjoiris. Wherever a liv
 ing, beating human heart is enshrined within
 a tabernacle of clay—be it amid polar snows,
 or beneath tlic glare of a tropical sun, or in
 more favored or gcuul, climes, under whatever
 circumstances, or in whatever situation —there
 is ever a broad and aoi(dc scope for the action
 of these glorious principles. They iwqiect
 not alone the out word deed, but inquire into
 and influence the hidden thonght. Not only
 are they opposed to the manifestations, but
 equally so to all the spirit of war.” Where,
 then, is a col so lowly, where a hying so for
 saken, that the spirit Wf tlic bond should not
 enter that dwelling and kindle a fresh glow
 around tlic hearth—and that heart, to give a
 new vigor and joy to its vital pulses! There
 is hardly as actiou of public sr of private life,
 hardly a thought of the statesman, or mer
 chant, or scholar, or citizen, or of wuman in
 any of her social positions, which not
 be beautified and purified by a wraft from
 the wings of this gentle and loving spirit.
 In the human heart, this principle should
 be an eminontly growing wd eyer-expanding

 No; tbc House of Common*, as »l p*ree«i
 coasmoted, is chiefly ieteetH lit the mkhlle
 clasajs, wlm, politically arc the nswt ignof
 »ant part of flte peri pi 1: of Great Britain. The
 l middle class is composed chiefly of dissenters,

 1 few exceptions, know very little about prac
 tical religion.
 John Bull bos his ow n way of doing every
 thing, and his route is generally a rather cir
 cuitous one. 3Le has such a high opinion ol
 1 himself, that no one can teach him. But he
 has one virtue, and rtiat .stands out in bold
 relief. His stubbornness has scarcely any
 parallel' iri the history of humanity and 0.1
 j this one virtue and its proper use at the pro
 sent time, his whole hope of safety depends.
 I If he briug3 it to bear upon the government
 in a right way, he may forte Lord John Rus
 sell or aomd other of our Prime. Ministers,
 to give such reform* as the time* demand.
 I, Euro;'! presents a change aspect. A Rr
 f public i« France seems quito a settled matter.
 (J :nnanv has at Fast one republic tit prrispoct;
 for although the King of Prussia is manmu
 vering and trying to cajole and hoodwink his
 .subject*, they perfectly see through him, and
 appear to be using him a* a tool to serve their
 present purposes, while he goes ou believing
 that he can manage them to secure his own
 ends. From this view, I would not lie sur
 prised to soe one largo Republic established in
 1 the scutre of Europe in a frw months, on the
 ruins of the many small duchies and kingdoms
 lof Germany. Italy is fldit marching to the
 same conclusion. Hungary' ta already said to
 b: form-’dinto a republic, and will in all pro
 j haliility swallow up Moldavia, Wallachia, and
 probably Servia, to the great indignation of
 the autocrat of Russia. Belgium and llol
 land must also become republic is self defence,
 1 for uo Kingly Government can long exist in
 ilia midst of Democracies.
 When the world is thus jumping as it’ wpre
 1 at once, to a rational system of government,
 j what is to become of England?' Can she
 stand still in the midst of progress? It is im
 possible. An agricultural nation might possi
 lily do so; hut for a commercial and manufac
 turing country to attempt it, would be the m
 plus xdU'-i of madness. Freedom is the soul ol
 trade, and the institutions of England must be
 I 1 0
 1 the freest of the free, if slie is to maintain hoi
 position amongst the nations. She cannot
 exist without commerce. She may for a time
 retain her Queen and aristocracy but not long.
 She must get rid of her d'bt, and reclaim her
 establishments the wealth of the country
 must be di.-tributed, as it is, it can no longer
 yield a revenue to meet the wants of the go
 vernment, without uterly distroying the mid
 dle— the shop keeping class. Reform is
 more the interest of this, than the working
 class, They have not yet learned this fact,
 but they will ere long. The only inode of
 access to John Bull's brains, is through his
 pocket, and it is amazing how clear-sighted
 he become* whenever that in touched and J
 now expect to see the principles of freedom
 -extend much more rapidly than the mo9t san
 guine have hitherto supposed possible.

 A Difficult Cask. —The Quakers in Vir
 ginia seem to be placed in a peculiar relation
 to the laws of Virginia. The Yearly Meeting
 of Baltimore, to which they belong, has
 charged all its members to educate the free
 colored people. The laws of Virginia forbid
 it, and the Friends have addressed a memorial
 to the General Assembly X the Mate X V ir
 -1 ginia, asking liberty to pursue the advice X
 their Yearly Meeting. If liberty i* »ot given,
 we do not know what course the Friends will
 take. 1
