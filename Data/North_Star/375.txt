 The Cuban Rebellion.— The Washing
 ton correspondent ol the Baltimore Sun makes
 the following statements.
 “Dispatches, we understand, have been re
 ceived from the American consul at Havanna,
 confirming, in a great measure the rumored
 insurrection in Cuba. A soldier in the can
 topian Regiment, while on parade, was heard
 to shout “Viva la Repubhca!” “\iva Gen.
 Lopez”
 The officer in command immediately drew
 his sword and advanced to cut him down,
 when at the instant another soldier levelled
 his musket and shot the officer through the
 heart. Gen. Lopez, for whom the soldier
 shouted, is the Spaniard who has already
 made some noise m New \oik, and is be
 lieved io he one of the principal movers in the
 late “secret expedition.” If proof were ne
 cessary to show that the object of the expedi
 tion v\«is a descent upon Cuba, this would go
 far to prove it. 1 he Cuban Government
 were serioulv thinking ot letting the slaves
 loose against the insui gents and if this hor
 rible* plan is put hi operation, we may look for
 a repetition ofthe Rightful scenes of St. Do
 mingo.
 The New Orleans Bee says, we have been
 favored bv a friend with the perusal of a pri
 vate letter from Havana, coining fioin a well
 informed source. It furnishes some mteiest
 irig information touching I lie seditious move
 ments in the Island. It appears that at Puer
 to Principe ihe Cantabrian Regiment had re
 volted and pronounced in favor of Gen. Nar-
 CiSso Lo|* z, w ho, our readers will remember,
 escaped some mouths a(*o lro:n Cuba, where
 sentence of death had been pronounced a
 gaiust him, and is now in the I'mied States.
 The regiment openly rebelled, murdered their
 Colonel, and killed and wounded several of
 11, e officers. As soon as the intelligence
 reached Havana, prompt means weie taken by
 the( apiam General to suppress the cmeute. A
 large number of troops, consisting ot three
 baiiallK.ns of the Havana regiment, the Ba
 tallor: de Kspana the Mule Artillery, King s
 Lancers, and the Rural and Militia avalry,
 w ere forth with despatched to Puerto Principe
 anii Tnuuiad. All the merchant vessels ett
 gaged in the coasting trade were pressed into
 the service, and employed in the transporta
 tion of troops. Them were no Spanish men
 oi w*i in ihe port—the only one there, the
 bn;* Patriots, having been freighted with pro
 visions and amumt. on, and sent off at midnight,
 on tnc 2d.
 ft The authorities appeared to consider the
 affair very serious, and were determined to
 crush it in the bud. Their preparations were
 made actively, extensively and secretly; and
 ihe public panic is inert as d in consequence
 of the absence of correct ai d specific informa
 tion in relation to the out-break.
 The American press is just now in very bad
 odor with the Captain General. He lias is
 sued a decree interdicting the d siribuitun ui
 any papers coining from the United .Stales,
 excepting La Chronica, of New-York. All
 others are detained m the posiofiice and
 burnt.

 To M. H. Be&amp;)(■ am, Lanatillt, Oho
 Dbab Sr«l koto received your lettei
 deled Sept. sth in which you suggest Dm
 enterprise of eeubiiefeof newspaper to bt
 located et boom eligible pent ie the State ai
 an organ of the colored people of Ohio, oe
 heating my advice and opinion on the subject
 and alto my semcts at the head of the enter
 print at oittor tod conductor of inch paper,
 should it established.
 I am fully eentible of tba purity of Um
 motives and the pressing demands vrbicl
 prompted tbe faithful enterprising gentlemen,
 our brethren, to suggeat such a movement
 and should be stupidly vain indeed, did I no
 acknowledge the compliment and defercnct
 paid, and the confidence reposed in me, bj
 selecting me to head the noble bend of color
 ed freemen of your State, in an enterprise
 laudable, honorable, philanthropic, and inevi
 labiy glorious, could tbe project be tweceas
 fully carried out. You set an estimate upor
 my knowledge of the State, and aak my opin
 ion accordingly. 1 shall at ooce proceed to
 give that opinion unreserved and unrestrained.
 Having traversed the length and breadth oi
 your State during five months of the last
 year, I acquired a tolerable knowledge of the
 condition and resources of our brethren ol
 Ohio, and their probability of auceese in the
 event of such an issue.
 The colored population of the State, is
 now using twenty thousand, a body of people
 in all conscience much too great to he without
 an organ or special advocate. Making the
 allowance of one sixth of this number only,
 it gives three thousand, three hundred and
 thirty-three families, who should be sufficient
 ly adequate to the sustenance of any single
 newspaper. Theae families it must be admit
 ted are generally well to do—being industri
 ous; they are mostly property holders, many
 of whom are farmers and mechanics, and
 oonaequently, men and women of means and
 money.
 But there is another consideration. In no
 rms community in the State, is there a tbous
 »nd of a population of colored people save
 Cincinnati and Columbus, the former of
 which is rising five thousand, and the latter
 me. Again, to ensure the success of a news
 paper, two things arc necessary—a reading
 and a business community. The first to en
 sure subscriptions, and the other support by
 advertisements. These are what give life to
 and ensure the existence of the various pub
 lic journals of the country, except the re
 formatory, which are always a drag and bur
 den to their conductors, drooping through a
 period of beggarly existence, coming at last
 to a pitiable end. Such a result should be
 henceforth studiously avoided by us in every
 enterprise, having ever occupied a beggarly
 position, and God knows, only regarded as
 he objects of pity.
 In any given number of colored families
 where the heads consist of elderly persons,
 here is always a ratio of two thirds who
 tannot read, leaving but one third, but a
 Kirtion of whom are in circumstances that
 will justify them in supporting a paper; but a
 faction of which portion again may be wili
 ng, allowing all reasonable excuses and ob
 ections so common among our people. This
 slimate will hold good particularly among
 he three thousand families in Ohio, (Cin
 cinnati being an exception,) as the greater
 part are immigrants from different parts of the
 South.
 Three thousand families, remotely scattered
 jver the State, with no one community suffi
 sient to sustain such a project; with all their
 various misconceptions and prejudices—pre
 dilections and biases, imbibed and instilled in
 the South, and the difficulty in obtaining
 suitable agents to secure subscribers and col
 lect money sufficient to sustain the enterprise,
 renders the undertaking at once so difficult,
 that it looks in the distance to be insurmount
 able; and having had seven years’ experience
 in editing and conducting newspapers, and an
 ixtensive acquaintance among our people—
 with their situation, condition, and otherwise,
 in other places as well as Ohio, I unhesitat
 ingly expreas my doubt of the ultimate suc
 cess of the project, believing that it would
 end with great losses to the undertakers, and
 in its failure, produce consequences that
 would give much cause for future regret.
 There are at present two or more news-i
 papers in existence published by colored men,
 devoted to the cause of our people all of
 which are merely dogging at the threshold of
 loubta and fears—asking aid at the gateway
 et impatient benevolence —their conductors
 depending upon personal friends, to whom
 they are almost compelled from necessity to
 rater and pander for their scanty means of
 lubsistence. If one or two papers cannot be
 fustained, surely an additional number must
 make the prospects slid the less and in my
 tumble opinion, I should much prefer that we
 would suppoit one good paper, ably and pro
 »er]y conducted, adapted to our demands,
 wants and condition than to have several iu
 sxistence, barely floating with exhausted
 wings upon theebbing-tide and worn out pati
 ence of Philanthropy—gouging to tbe vitals,
 rad abstracting the very life-blood of the
 rharity of the public and community in which
 ;hey exist.
 1 have, Sir, other and personal objections
 to entenng into such an enterprise. I have
 never been sufficiently successful in the cause
 jf our brethren to have s value set upon my
 •fforts. I have labored for nought, and re
 vived nothing. If I except the use of fifty
 lollais borrowed from a donation of one hun
 dred dollars, presented by the Ladies' Fair to
 tbe North Star, which sum I have still to
 pay, the present of a sum of ten dollars, and
 various articles of clothing for myself and
 wife and little children, during my stay in
 Philadelphia last winter, by several excellent
 colored ladies, is mors than I ever before re
 alised, during seven years labor as editor of
 Jifierent papers, the last eighteen months of
 urUicfa time, were devoted entirely to the cause.
 I am fully persuaded, that to embark in a
 new enieipiisc of this kind, would be heed
 less in ms, and the last precipitous stride and
 gasping struggle to the certain starvation of
 mv family, whom 1 «n bound by all ths urn
 j( consanguinity *nd self-respect, and what
 stronger than self love—of conjugal and
 filial affection, to protect and support—pro
 tect alike against starvation as wallas oppres
 sion sod personal injury and abuse. This I
 hope will constitute sufficient icaeau hi my

 If the whole can be aostained or any par

 lat ions, and consequently be able to approciau
 such enterprises, end the labors of those o
 their brethren who are willing to snerifiet
 their all, and wear out their lives in the aer
 vice of their people and cause of their rac&lt;
 and humanity.
 I say rally around the North Star, becauM
 of the several papers now in existence, if ii
 on the firmest basis, having the greatest pros
 pects of suoese, and if it cannot be sustain
 ed, the hope for the continuance of others ii
 as the distant glimmering of an expended
 meteor. We are not yet in a condition in
 this country to support more than one effici
 ent newspaper. This I have stated on a
 former occasion, when connected with tha
 North Star, and my present relation to the
 paper makes the fact none the less truthful.
 I have no other desire than to do that which
 I conceive to be jost and right towards God
 and man—to justify myself without wrong
 ing my neighbor. I detest that dog-in-the
 manger ambition, which, because I cannot eat
 the hay myself, will suffer no other one to eat
 it; land that Pharisaical philanthropy,
 which because Israel cannot be gathered to
 gether, would prevent Jacob from receiving
 hit reward. No, thank God, I have a dif
 ferent object and higher aim in view—the
 elevation of our race—l care not by whom it
 be effected so that it be properly done: Let it
 be Henry Highland Garnet, Samuel R.
 Ward, W. W. Brown, Henry Bibb, Charles
 Lenox Reraoud, Frederick Douglass, or
 whom.
 I have no ambition whatever fox' popular
 fame and personal distinction in the heaven
 decreed pursuit ef philanthropy. It admits
 ef no such rivalry. That which partakes of
 the nature of Deity, can possess neither
 hatred nor envy. It ia an assumption to
 force one's services where they are not wan
 ted, especially when they ere useless sad
 he who d«&gt;ee it is an intruder, if not a usur
 per. This being my case, 1 have determined
 to remain in the seclusion of obscurity, where
 I have ever been, wishing God-epeed to our
 public great men, in every good and lauda
 ble undertaking in which they may embark.
 You will herewith receive my humble ad
 vice against the establishment of a paper in
 Ohio, feeling fully assured that it will result
 in serious losses to the proprietors; and
 should such a project be carried out, though
 I may possibly at some future day become a
 resident of your great promising State, in a
 professional capacity I roost respectfully de
 cline the honor suggested to me, of becom
 ing the Editor of your paper, or in any
 wny responsibly interested in it.

 Address
 To the Anti-Slavery Ladies of Great Britain ana
 Ireland, from two English friends.
 Through the medium of the columns of
 the North Stab, we earnestly desire to
 solicit your aid and co-operation in the good
 Anti-Slavery cause; and we would plead
 with you more especially for assistance, on
 behalf of the Western New York Anti-Sla
 very Society.
 One of the objects of this Society is [to
 help to susiain the North Star newspaper,
 which is, we believe, one of the best Anti-
 Slavery instrumentalities now in operation.
 The Annual Anti-Slavery Fair will he
 held at Rochester towards the close of the
 year; and a series of Anti-Slavery Fairs are
 now being held in the towns and villages of
 Western New York; consequently there is
 an unusual demand for useful and fancy arti
 cles. We earnestly entreat our British
 friends to send us renewed help in the way
 of contributions.
 To our London friends, and to those living
 n Birmingham, Coventry, Leicester, Leeds,
 Sunderland and Bristol, we would sugge*
 that they forward their contributions, by the
 third week in October, to Miss Carpenter, of
 Bristol, who has this year kindly consented
 to forward the London box.
 To the frieods in Carlisle and Manchester,
 who sent boxes to Rochester last year, we
 renew our appeal, hoping and believing that
 they will continue to give us their aid and
 we trust that the Frieods in Newcastle on
 Tyne, Northampton, Colebrookdale, Edin
 burgh, Belfast, and Cork, who then joined
 them in this good work, will testify, oo the
 present occasion, that they are M not weary it
 well-doing.”

 An Appeal ta behalf of the Western
 New York Anti-Slavery Fair.
 Earnestly desiring the abolition of Slavery
 in this land, and being deeply convinced that
 this result can only be accomplished by renew
 ed efforts to change our present corrupt moral
 sentiment, the undersigned members and
 friends of the Western New York Anti-slavery
 Society, again make their appeal to the
 friends of the Slave in behalf of their annual
 Bazaar, which will be held in Rochester in
 December next.
 While we have been cheered and gladdened
 by the progress already made, and the good
 alteady done, and while we rejoice to observe
 that friends have been raised up to plead the
 cause of the bondman among persons, and in
 quarters where we had least expected theta,
 we still see the "harvest to be great and the
 laborers to be few,” and instead of relaxing
 out efforts, we are impressed with a sense of
 the duty of doubling our diligence, and ap
 plying more closely our energy to the means
 of advancing this holy cause—We appeal the
 more boldly to our friends because those for
 whom we plead cannot plead for themselves.
 While we are surrounded by our domestic
 circle, with none to molest or make us afraid,
 there are three millions of men and women in
 our own land, doomed to abject Slavery and
 chains, robbed of every right—civil—social—'
 personal —and political. Remembering those
 in bonds as bound with them, we desire to
 plead their cause as though they were on our
 own limbs, and the knotted lash were applied
 to our own backs.
 While to obtain means for enlightening the
 public mind, is the strong motive for holding
 our arnual Fair, it is not the only one. A
 great amount of good may be traced directly j
 to such occasions. Many who are now ac-1
 tive workers in behalf of this holy movement
 became first interested in it through the in
 strumentality of those annua) exhibitions of
 anti-slavery industry, tact and Bkill. j
 The present object of the Ri*cheater anti
 slavery Bazaar is for the general enlighten
 ment of the public mind on the subject of sla
 very. Recognizing the North Star, (published
 in this city) as an efficient Anti-Slavery ill-.
 strumentality, we propose that the funds raised j
 by the Sale of articles at the Bazaar (on
 behalf of whieh we here appeal) shall be
 maiuly appropriated to the support of that
 important paper.
 We gatefuily acknowledge the prompt as
 sistance rendered to oar last Fair by our
 friends and coadjutors in various parte of our
 own State, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and we
 earnestly solicit their continued co-operation
 with us in the good woik. That no tune may
 be loot, we especially recommend to them tbe
 immediate formation of sewing circles in their
 various towns with a view to making strides
 for the Rochester Bazaar. We would also
 in this connection render our heartfelt thanks
 to our British friends for the valnabte aid ex
 tended by them to our last years Fair and
 we would again warmly &amp;olicu their generooa i
 assistance. It is due to our trans-Atlantic
 friends to sav that for much of tbe interest felt
 in our last Bazaar we were indebted to them,
 and we are persuaded that their continued
 co-operation will essentially promote tbe aoe
 eess of our approaching December Bazaar,
 and the advancement of the cause of the slave
 in our land.
 We hope that the foregoing appeal will
 commend itself to out philanthropic friends on
 both aides of the Atlantic, and that they will
 cordially unite with ua in the effoit here pro
 posed.

 Cohschftios. rhere is perhaps no disease
 with which our country is affected, which sweeps
 off so many victims, as that fell destroyer of the
 human race Consumption. Day after day, year
 after year, that insatiate monster hurries to the por
 tals of the cold aad silent tomb fresh added victims
 to its conquest. No walk of life is sacred from its
 blighting influence. No age is exempt from its
 death-dealing shafts. The old, the middle-aged and
 the young, all alike, are food for this common enemy
 of mankind. The white-haired patriarch, whose
 life of temperance has rendered his system impervi
 ous to the attacks of other ills, and whose good
 deeds prepared him for the enjoyment of life’s calm
 evening, finds Consumption fastening its fangs i.pon
 his vitals,and tearing him from a world ever bright
 to minds which look complacently on days well
 spent.
 Is there no help for the afflicted!—no preventive
 of the dangers which beset us in our changeable and
 fickle clime! We think there is. And if the alle
 gations of those who are at least entitled to veracity
 may be believed, there is a preventive and a remedy.
 W istar’s Balsam of Wild Cherry is offered to a suf
 fering world as such. It needs not the “adventi
 tious aid” of a long string of fictitious certificates to
 give it notoriety. Iu true value and intrinsic ex
 cellence, are sufficient to entitle it to the confidence
 of the public, and to “waft on to fame” the name of
 its Inventor, as a benefactor of his species.
 None genuine unless signed I. BUTTS on the

ATHOL WATER CURE.
 rE Subscriber begi leave to call tie attention
 of Invalids, especially those suffering from
 chronic disease, to his hydropathic establishment in
 Athol, Mass.
 His house was opened for the reception of patients
 last season, and it is believed offers oncelient facili
 ties for a philosophic and J borough course in hydro
 pet by The supply of water is attendant, and m
 purity has been pronounced equal to water on a
 distilled.” The locatiou is quite eligible, being but
 a short distance from the V. kM. railroad. The
 vicinity abounds ia a variety of scenery, and has
 grounds (or walks and rambles. tfo that
 with the water, suitable regimen, mountain air, and
 exercise, patients can scarcely foil to obtain the
 healthful results for which they labor.
 The following case illustrates tins remark. Mrs.
 8., wife of Dea. 8., of Warwick, Mass., ag-d
 about thirty-five years, was brought to me last
 August. Her case presented the following pheno
 mena. If placed ia an erect position, and left un
 supported, she forthwith fell backward to the
 ground. If being well supported, she made an
 effort to walk, either foot, whew carried forward,
 her efforts to the contrary, would cross ibe
 other. She had been ia this condition nearly a
 year. Her treatment commenced the 16th of Meyt.,
 aad was tensued to the 25th Oct. only, when she
 Mi, so for recovered as to be able to walk hail a
 mile with ease. Since her return to her fiunily, she
 has continued her baths, with corresponding
 prtrvesueut to her health, She now attends to for
 domestic duties, aad with the assistance of a small
 girl, does the work of her foamly.
 Patients are desired to bring three comfortables,
 owe pair of wooden Mask els, qae pur of sheets,
 half a doaea towels marked, with old tinea for
 bandages.
 Term, from five to tea dollars per wank, acrord
 iag to ths access it ire or choice of the patient#.
 Those who are less particular ia the mkctioo oi
 rooms, or are willing to occupy them in common
 with others, will he dmrfud less.
