Chief Constructor Philip Which born the nay
will read a paper today upon the care and
preservation of our new steel ships Mrs
Itch born paper says that the mode
earn war vessel Is a piece of exceedingly
delicate mechanism and that the rapid
deterioration of even Its stationary parts can
only be circumvented by ceaseless caution arid
constant attention to minute drills The popup
lar impression that a new ship does not required
repairs Is quickly demolished when the qualia
ties and functions of one of the three modern
battleships the Indiana the Massachusetts or
Oregon are considered The size of such a
sells equal to a cube whose side Is I about Of
feet In this space the men must eat live and
sleep a also contains a the tons of cost
and enormous machinery for driving the
ship There are for your guns ranging from
Incl rifle with their half on projectiles the
the six millimetre falling Tons upon tons
of ammunition for all these weapons must
be carried Iii quantities to provide for
a prolonged fight The enormous protect
time armour enters Into the calculation
and the structure which supports a these
weights and provides all the accommodations
must be subdivided Into small compartments
which Iii turn must be constantly supplied with
fresh air and be capable of being pumped with
The wear and tear of such complicated limo
turn Is I evidently rand and It Is I only by the
stitch in time that It ran be maintained In
readiness for active services
The fouling of a vessels bottom Is an expend
site mutter And It Is Intimately connected with
the ships tight iii efficiency
The only remedy for this Is I to sheath ships
European nation arc sheathing their war vest
sell with With and copper American ships
must a sheathed College
The United States has but seven Govern
men docks none of which will received
the battle ships With the exception of
one at Halifax there I no other dock In
the western hemisphere that will hold the bath
tie ship In time of war the embarrassment
would be serious as frequent docking Is re
quire to keep steel ships In efficient conditions
while sheathed ships need not a docked for
years at a time
